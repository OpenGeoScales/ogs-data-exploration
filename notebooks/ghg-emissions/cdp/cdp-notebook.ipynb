    "**To Do :**\n",
    "- [x] geospacial analysis\n",
    "- [x] update geospacial analysis considering that many cities do not have any emissions (490 VS 723)\n",
    "- [x] create new columns scope_1, Scope_2 and Scope_3 with the total value of emissions\n",
    "- [ ] check what are BASIC emissions\n",
    "- [ ] analysis of emissions time series (min/max, distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also :\n",
    "- [ ] see why some cities appear 4 times (Stockolhm for example)\n",
    "- [ ] Missing cities: extract city name from \"Organization\" by matching it with a reference list (of cities names per country)\n",
    "- [ ] plot cities in a map to assert that coordinates are actually true (do it for some countries)\n",
