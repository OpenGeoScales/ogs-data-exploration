ADEME is a public Environment and Energy Management Agency in France. ADEME is active in the implementation of public policy in the areas of the environment, energy and sustainable development. ADEME makes its expertise and consultancy capacities available to companies, local authorities, public authorities and the general public and helps finance projects in five areas (waste management, soil conservation, efficiency energy and renewable energies, air quality and noise reduction) and to progress in their sustainable development initiatives.

To meet regulatory obligations and support the energy and ecological transition, ADEME has decided to make its data available to businesses, local authorities, public authorities and the general public in order to enable them to progress in their environmental approach by the mean of [an open data portal](https://data.ademe.fr/).

- **Bilan Carbone**

Bilan Carbone® refers to the methods developed by ADEME and Association Bilan Carbone (ABC) to enable organizations and local government authorities (respectively Bilan Carbone® and Bilan Carbone® Territoire) to address, measure and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These inventories are published on the [ADEME GES platform](https://www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/). ADEME publishes the GHG reports entered by organizations via [a search engine](https://www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/fr/bilanenligne/bilans/index/siGras/0) on its site, but does not publish the consolidated underlying database of all the reports. It is therefore possible to view each report one by one, but not to perform automated processing on this data.
