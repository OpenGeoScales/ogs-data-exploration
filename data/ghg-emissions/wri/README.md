The World Resources Institute (WRI) is a global research non-profit organization promoting environmental sustainability, economic opportunity, and human health and well-being. WRI's activities are focused on seven areas: food, forests, water, energy, cities, climate and ocean. It participates to the definition of Greenhouse Gas Protocol by providing standards, guidance, tools, and trainings for business and government to quantify and manage GHG emissions. 

WRI provides also access to historic GHG data allowing for easy access, analysis and visualization of the latest available international greenhouse gas emissions data. It includes information for 191 countries and the European Union, 50 U.S. states, 6 gases, multiple economic sectors, and 160 years - carbon dioxide emissions for 1850-2014 and multi-sector greenhouse gas emission for 1990-2014.

# Data

Data provider | Description | Geoscale | Data sources | Access |
---|---------|---|---| ---| 
The World Resources Institute (WRI) | The World Resources Institute compiles various sources of GHG emissions and provide access to this data through a specific tool: [CLIMAT WATCH](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&historical-emissions-gases=&historical-emissions-regions=&historical-emissions-sectors=&page=1). Provided [GHG emissions data](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&historical-emissions-gases=&historical-emissions-regions=&historical-emissions-sectors=&page=1) is based on various data sources: CAIT database, UNFCCC, PIK.  | `World scale` <br /> `Country scale`|  `CAIT` `UNFCCC` `PIK`  | [Get data](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&historical-emissions-gases=&historical-emissions-regions=&historical-emissions-sectors=&page=1) |


## Sector Coverage

- agriculture
- bunker fuels
- energy (electricity/heat, fugitive emissions, manufacturing/ construction, other fuel combustion, transportation)
- industrial processes
- waste
- other
- land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) : 

The UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Decision 24/CP.19) provide, among others, guidance on the estimation and reporting of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol caused by activities relating to LULUCF. The guidance stipulates that reporting under the UNFCC covers all anthropogenic emissions and removals from the lands included in the LULUCF sector (land based approach). In principle, this approach applies a wall-to-wall comprehensive inventory of anthropogenic **sources** and **sinks** of greenhouse gases over the land units subject to activities relating to land use, land use change and forestry.

**sinks** : The rate of build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere can be reduced by taking
advantage of the fact that carbon can accumulate in vegetation and soils in
terrestrial ecosystems. Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a
greenhouse gas from the atmosphere is referred to as a "sink." Denoted in
accounting and reporting with the negative (-) sign. [source](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52016SC0249&from=EN)

**sources** : The rate of emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere can be increased by
anthorpogenic action releasing carbon accumulated in vegetation and soils in
terrestrial ecosystems. Any process, activity or mechanism which releases a
greenhouse gas from the atmosphere is referred to as a "source." Denoted in
accounting and reporting with the negative (+) sign. [source](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52016SC0249&from=EN)

"*Deforestation (2.2%)* : net emissions of carbon dioxide from changes in forestry cover. This means reforestation is counted as ‘negative emissions’ and deforestation as ‘positive emissions’. Net forestry change is therefore the difference between forestry loss and gain. Emissions are based on lost carbon stores from forests and changes in carbon stores in forest soils."
