Municipality of Belo Horizonte,35848,Brazil,Belo Horizonte,,2013,Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) Pilot Version 1.0 (C40 and ICLEI),"In this inventory are presented the following issues:

1) Emissions from Stationary Sector Units, which are sub-sectored emissions in residential, commercial / institutional, industrial and power generation, essentially related to energy consumption profile in each building;

2) Emissions Sector Mobile Units, which are sub-sectored in emissions by road transport, rail and air, reflecting the energy matrix of the transport system deployed in the city;

3) Emissions from Waste Sector, which are sub-sectored in emissions by waste disposal in landfill, biological treatment and waste treatment / disposal of effluents.

GHG emissions by fuel consumption
Different concentrations of biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) were established by the national authority for the distribution of Automotive Gasoline and Diesel. These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry.
GHG emissions for electricity consumption
The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. 
GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents
Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide: Arrudas STP, located in Sabará / MG which receiving wastewater of Belo Horizonte and Contagem / MG; Onça STP located in Belo Horizonte and also receives a fraction of sewage Contagem / MG; Olhos D'Água STP and Minas Solidária STP, located in Belo Horizonte and receive exclusive city sewers. There are a fifth STP, ETAF Sarandi/Ressaca that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases.
Moreover, a fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration.
Only a fraction derived of Belo Horizonte was considered in all STP which emit methane and nitrous oxide:
Arrudas STP
The Arrudas STP employs an activated sludge system for wastewater treatment, which is an aerobic system generates a high volume of biological sludge. This biological sludge is taken to stabilization in anaerobic reactors equipped with flow meters and methane content of biogas. There are too a firing device for biogás treatment.
Onça STP, Olhos D’Água STP e Minas Solidária STP
These stations employ wastewater treatment UASB reactors for wastewater treatment, which is a system emitting methane and nitrous oxide. These STP not have flow meters and methane content of the biogas. 
Autodepuration of Sewage in water bodies
A portion of the sewage collected by the local utility is disposal without any treatment in any water bodies, and emits methane.
Sewage Treatment Not Collected
The amount of sewage that is collected by the local utility can be arranged in various ways.
GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste
Landfill
The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill in the municipality of Santa Luzia / MG (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed, as a measure of conservatism, that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere.
A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, GHG emissions due to waste disposal in landfill in a given year will be distributed in the following years, generating a passive emission, in decreasing order. For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.
Composting
BH also conducts composting for organic waste. These activities take place in the CTRS Rod BR-040 and may incur nitrous oxide and methane.

Stadt Zürich,35449,Switzerland,Zürich,,2013,Other: Methodology according to the 2000-Watt society (www.2000watt.ch),"The 2000-Watt society methodology is a concept of sustainable development that uses two indicators: Primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).

Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.

Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services.

All calculations in regards to primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions are made with the balancing program ECORegion (http://www.ecospeed.ch/).",2010-01-01 - 2010-12-31,1973200,"Between 1990 and 2010 the greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Zurich have been significantly reduced, from approximately 6 tonnes to currently around 5 tonnes per person per year. This represents a reduction of almost 15 percent in the last 20 years. The main part of the reduction has been achieved in the area of buildings. One the one hand, thermo-technical improvements in buildings led to a reduction of the heat requirements. On the other hand, the increased use of district heating and the replacement of oil-fired heating systems contributed by gas heating and heat pump systems resulted in a further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels.","Further information can be found in the attached documents as well as under:

City of Vancouver,20113,Canada,Vancouver,C40,2013,Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) Pilot Version 1.0 (C40 and ICLEI),"Community Electricity and Natural Gas Emissions  - Data will be provided by the electricity and natural gas utilities for 2012 but not until April 2013. The data in place right now is an estimate based on the previous year's data.

Community Light-Duty Vehicle (LDV) Emissions
Vancouver's LDV emissions for 1990 and 2008 were estimated using annual Vancouver gasoline sales (from tax proceeds data) multiplied by a correction factor and the gasoline emission factor.  A correction factor was applied recognizing that as the largest regional employment node and with many of the regional recreational facilities, considerably more people travel to Vancouver (and therefore purchase fuel here) from surrounding municipalities than leave it on a daily basis.  
 
The correction factor was determined using Vancouver's original (2005) methodology for estimating LDV GHG emissions which was grounded on real data from AirCare testing on vehicle mileage for 1993, 1996, 1999, and 2002.  While this original methodology was a robust approach, it had to be abandoned due to changes in Air Care testing after 2002.  In this original methodology, Vancouver's share of regional gasoline sales for any given year was determined from the ratio of the total mileage of vehicles registered and insured in Vancouver compared to the total mileage of vehicles registered and insured in the region.  
 
The correction factor for the current methodology was based on the ratio of Vancouver's share of regional fuel sales compared against actual fuel sales in Vancouver.  This approach resulted in a correction factor of 0.99 for 1990 (based on the ratio for 1993 which was closest year for which actual data was available) and 0.91 for 2008 (based on the average ratio for 1996, 1999, and 2002).


Community Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) Emissions
Vancouver’s 2012 HDV emissions were based on Metro Vancouver modelling in the  “2005 Lower Fraser valley Air Emissions Inventory & Forecast and Backcast-Full Report” .  This report included new VKT estimates from Translink’s regional transportation model that are applicable for 2005 but not necessarily at the local level for earlier years back to 1990.  

For 2005, Metro Vancouver apportioned greenhouse gas emissions for the spatial regions within the Canadian Lower Fraser Valley.  For 2005, the City of Vancouver was allocated 14.4% of the Metro Vancouver greenhouse gas emissions (11.3 of the Lower Fraser Valley).  

The percentage of HDV’s in the >=5,000kg weight class was only available for the Lower Fraser Valley(LFV). Therefore, the same percentage was applied to Vancouver with the assumption that that breakdown of HDV vehicles sizes was generally the same at the local and regional level.

The 2011 projection is based on available regional data or nation projections for the different sources.

The data from Statistics Norway is based on the Kyoto protocol methodology.

Biological treatment of organic waste in Oslo has been starting up. The Anaerobic Food and Sludge Processing Plant shall produce bio methane for buses and biofertilizer for around 100 middle sized farms. The plan are presently being put into operation, thus there will be no emission or energy output calculated for 2011 and 2012.","The emission data for 2011 are preliminary and calculated as a forecast of the 2009 emissions, These data that has estimated by Statistic Norway and the forecast is made by the City of Oslo.
Between 1991 and 2009, emissions increased by 13 percent to 1.32 million tons. Half of GHG emissions in Oslo in 2009 came from the transport sector, however the use of fossil fuels for heating also contributed to substantial emissions; stationary combustion accounted for 38 percent of emissions in 2009. The City Council then asked the national government to permit a local tax on heating oil in order to reach the city target of phasing out all oil heating by 2020. This was rejected, but we are expecting a better regulatory and investment scheme that allows for a more rapid phasing out of oil heating.
 
While total emissions increased in Oslo 1991-2009, emissions per capita declined by 9 percent. Oslo’s increased by more than 100,000 between 1991 and 2009. This has led to increased emissions from transport and energy; however most of the increase in energy use stems from electricity which does not lead to direct GHG emissions (i.e. scope 2). Thus, the main target for reducing GHG emissions is the transport sector. Since Oslo is a transport hub in central Norway, this is challenging. The main strategies have been to enhance public transport (investments, operations and traffic flow) and increased use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the urban region (today more than 4000 EVs and rapidly growing). 
 
Today, Oslo has relatively low emissions per capita compared to other Norwegian and Scandinavian cities; around 2.3 tons of CO2 equivalents per person in 2009. This is partly because there are no large industrial companies in the municipality, and that there is great use of hydropower. In addition, much of the demand for transport in Oslo is covered by public transport, walking and cycling, partly because of a dense urban structure.","(59.9138688, 10.7522454)","(60.472024, 8.468946)"

•	scope 1 and 3 emissions for the fuel consumption from road traffic, non-road vehicles and shipping, and scope 1 emissions from aviation (within the landing and take-off cycle, i.e. up to 915m).

This means that scope 3 emissions from transportation of Stockholmers outside the community boundary is not included (but transportation of non-Stockholmers within the community boundary is included). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.

Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001. The report is widely used and acknowledged in Sweden. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2007, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).

Energy statistics are collected from different sources.

There are two ways to look at energy-related CO2 emissions: (1) The calculation of carbon balance based on primary energy sources is subdivided by the sources of emissions, energy transformation and final energy consumption. This method shows only the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the city but it does not include the impact of external electricity trade. Therefore, the consumption of final energy consumers is not reflected. That is why Berlin prefers method (2) which is a consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions. This methodology of calculating CO2 emissions is based on data from the end-use sectors, and puts electricity imports into account. It also adds to the end-users’ emissions those produced by generation of electricity and district heating in the energy transformation sector. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions is therefore one indicator to find out the end-users’ emissions in a region.

City of Warsaw,31185,Poland,Warsaw,C40,2013,2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,"Warsaw prepared the inventory (more precisely, the calculation of carbon footprint)  in 2008, which covered the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2007. The methodology used was taken from the United Nations IPCC works. The area of calculation was: electricity and heat used, transport (public and individual), communal waste management, sewage treatment as well as carbon sequestration by soil and biomass. The emissions from electricity used were calculated by first collecting the information from the users and then multiplying it by an appropriate CO2 emissions indicator based on national energy mix in Poland. The same indicator was used for years 1990, 1995, 2000, while for the year 2007 the indicator was different. The emissions from heat were calculated using the data about production of heat from different types of fuel. Next, on the basis of CO2 emissions indicators for each kind of fuel the final calculation was done. The calculation for transport was divided in four categories: individual cars, pick-ups, lorries and public transport. For each of them different indicators of CO2 emissions were used, depending on the year of vehicle production as well as on the share in the modal split. With regard to waste management, the amount of waste and the way of dealing with it allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent. The amount and characteristics of communal sewage, as well as the way it was treated, allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent. 
This methodology was used by the Institute for Sustainable Development while preparing the first Warsaw emission inventory - what resulted in number of 10 727 200 tonnes of CO2 for year 2007, which was reported in the previous edition of CDP. However, the latter calculations performed by the KAPE and NAPE energy agencies for purposes of Warsaw Sustainable Energy Action Plan used a slightly different methodology (including not counting absorption), following the SEAP guidelines from the Covenant of Mayors Office.

"City of Portland, Oregon",14874,USA,Portland,C40,2013,Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) Pilot Version 1.0 (C40 and ICLEI),"Portland and Multnomah County gather data on carbon emissions to inform policy and programmatic decisions and to monitor overall progress toward emission goals. In general, the methodology follows guidelines developed by ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability and uses the Clean Air and Climate Protection software developed jointly by ICLEI and STAPPA/ALAPCO.
 
This inventory is for all of Multnomah County. The City of Portland is 79% of Multnomah County by population. The inventory includes all emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, fuel oil (distillate and residual), propane, gasoline, diesel and solid waste disposal. These sources are discussed in further detail below.

Electricity is provided to customers in Multnomah County by Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power (PP). Both PGE and PP provide data on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) sold to their distribution customers in each of three sectors: residential, commercial and industrial. Because these total numbers include sales of “green power” (i.e., power generated from sources that do not emit carbon emissions) to customers who have elected to purchase such power, these numbers are adjusted to determine how many kWh were sold to customers in Multnomah County from the utilities’ standard sources. To calculate the carbon emissions from grid power, the inventory uses emission factors provided by ICLEI for the Northwest Power Pool of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

NW Natural, the sole natural gas utility for Multnomah County, provides data on the total therms used in the county by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The carbon emissions attributable to natural gas usage are calculated by multiplying the total number of therms by the conversion factor provided by ICLEI for converting therms to CO2-e. 

Fuel oil data are taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Report” contained in the Petroleum Supply Annual (EIA Report), which publishes data on the sales in Oregon of heating oil, propane and kerosene. Figures are broken down in the three residential, commercial and industrial customer classes. In the absence of more specific information about usage in Multnomah County, the inventory assigns the county a share based on the percent of Oregon’s population living in Multnomah County. ICLEI provides conversion factors for carbon emissions associated with each of these heating fuels. The carbon emissions from these fuels attributable to Multnomah County are calculated by multiplying the total amount of each fuel by the applicable conversion factor.

Emissions from gasoline are calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Multnomah County. The State of Oregon, which collects a county gas tax on behalf of Multnomah County, issues quarterly reports detailing the total gallons of gasoline sold in the county. Gasoline sales provide an imperfect measure, since clearly some people who drive in Multnomah County purchase gasoline outside of the county while others purchase it in the county but drive elsewhere. 

The EIA Report contains data for the sales in Oregon of diesel fuel and certain other transportation fuels used for rail, shipping, on-highway use, military uses and off -highway use. Because of the interstate and international character of air, rail and shipping, ICLEI recommends not attributing fuel used by these modes to a given locality, and the inventory excludes these. The inventory allocates to Multnomah County a share of Oregon’s total sales of diesel for on-highway and construction use according to population. 

Metro, the regional government for the Portland area, operates the solid waste transfer stations serving Multnomah County and provides data on the total tonnage of materials landfilled each year from the Metro region. The inventory assigns a share of the total tonnage to Multnomah County based on the percent of Metro population that is in Multnomah County. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducts studies to determine the composition of waste in Oregon landfills. Thus, it is possible to estimate the composition of waste buried in landfills that are attributable to Multnomah County.

Some landfills capture methane gas and flare it. For each landfill that receives waste from Metro, DEQ provides an estimate of the percentage of methane captured. Using ICLEI’s Clean Air and Climate Protection software, and based on the Metro tonnage data, DEQ waste composition studies and estimates of methane recapture rates, the inventory estimates the total amount of methane generated at landfills that is released into the atmosphere. Landfill emissions included in the inventory reflect the cumulative future methane emissions that can be expected from waste disposed in a given year, as opposed to the amount of actual methane emissions from landfills in that year.",2011-01-01 - 2011-12-31,7773812,"Portland and Multnomah County emissions increased by 1.6% from 2010. Overall emissions have declined since 1990, currently at -8.5% below 1990 levels. The increase from 2010 can largely be accounted for by increased use of electricty and natural gas from all sectors, in part as a result of a colder winter. Residential electricity use increased by about 1%, commercial by about 0.6% and industrial usage increased by 1.6%. Natural gas usage increased in all  three sectors, but primarily in the residential sector. However, total natural gas usage is still below 2008 levels.

This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying.

City of Baltimore,35853,USA,Baltimore,,2013,Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI),"ICLEI’s methodology provides a systematic framework for local governments to track energy- and waste-related activities in the community, and to calculate the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by each activity and sector. The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.

Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.",2010-01-01 - 2010-12-31,7579144,This is our baseline year.

City of San Francisco,31182,USA,San Francisco,C40,2013,International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI),"Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Direct Access Electricity: 
The majority of electricity used by the Residential, Commercial and Industrial sectors of San Francisco is purchased from PG&E. Exceptions to this are power to municipal operations, provided by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission (detailed in the Municipal Inventory guidance) and remaining Direct Access power customers.

Emissions from electricity are calculated by applying each electricity source’s unique carbon profile to the total MWh’s consumed by each supplier’s customers.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial Natural Gas: 
The residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal sectors of San Francisco purchase their natural gas from PG&E. The California Climate Action Registry stationary natural emission factors are applied to the activity data to determine tons of GHGs. CO2, N2O, and CH4 registry factors are combined into a single CO2e factor. Emission factors for natural gas are based on combustion only and do not include upstream methane leakage from extraction and distribution of natural gas.

Municipal Electricity (including MUNI fleet electricity): 
Electricity usage data for municipal operations is obtained from the SFPUC. The electricity EF is provided by the SFPUC and applied to the usage data to determine the CO2 emissions.

Municipal natural gas usage: 
Natural gas is delivered by PG&E.

Intra-regional & SF Road Vehicles: 
All vehicle related VMT have been consolidated into one report.  SFCTA provides modeled VMT data from their SFCHAMP model that includes all trips made by passenger vehicles and trucks within San Francisco and assigns half of the VMT associated with trips into or outside of SF.  The other half is attributed to the source or destination city per MTC guidance.  Pass-thru VMT are excluded from the total.  This methodology follows MTC guidance.  Daily VMT are multiplied by 330 to account for total weighted annual VMT where weekend demand is less than weekday. The 2010 CHAMP did not include emissions from buses or freight. 
CO2e emissions are provided by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District using the Air Resource Board’s EMFAC model database.  The emission factor varies by year based on fleet composition used in the model from the DMV and modeling assumptions.

The emission factors vary by year and were supplied by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District. They were derived using EMFAC.

Rail – Caltrain Diesel Fuel: 
Estimates on total system fuel usage are obtained as well as passenger data, specifically total ridership and number of de-boardings in San Francisco. The % of trips de-boarding in San Francisco is share of trips attributable to San Francisco. This percentage is then applied to the total fuel usage, and that amount of fuel is multiplied by the California Climate Action Registry CO2 factor for diesel from mobile sources to determine emissions.
 
Rail – BART Electricity: 
In order to estimate emissions from BART attributable to San Francisco market area, data and total system power consumption was obtained from BART staff. Transbay and Westbay ridership was considered attributable to San Francisco and was divided by total ridership to determine a market share % for San Francisco. This market share % was than multiplied by total system power usage to determine the San Francisco share of power usage. The total system power data is based on electric propulsion data from: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm. Emissions factor data is available from PG&E and is commonly published in internal/external reports on energy or GHG emissions.
  
Ferry – Diesel Fuel: 
Ferry data is an estimation of emissions from all Bay Area leisure and commuter ferries. Starting in 2009, the data for all 3 agencies included in SF’s inventory (City of Alameda, City of Vallejo, and Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District) is reported at: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm.  Mode type is ‘FB’.

MUNI – Diesel Fuel:
Estimates of diesel fuel used by the SF Municipal Transportation Authority (SFMTA) revenue fleet (buses) were obtained from the SFMTA. The biodiesel content was separated out and only the diesel portion was included in the inventory for diesel emissions calculations. 

Emissions were calculated per Equation TR.4.A.2. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Mobile Combustion of the U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Version 1.0, October 2012.

Considering 2006 IPCC G/L as standard methodology, Seoul has applied domestic activity and basic Emission Factors of the guideline for calculation as well as basic city data (energy consumption, waste, etc.). Emissions of 6 major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6) stated in the Kyoto Protocol were calculated and Seoul applied Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the second Assessment Report from the IPCC. 

3) Classification of emission source: 
In large, the classification is based on the 2006 IPCC G/L classification system but the categories were integrated or specified according to the characteristics of the city of Seoul. Based on the range of Seoul's authority, emission sources were classified into Scope 1 (Direct emission) and Scope 2 (Indirect emission), in accordance with the local GHG calculation guidelines.

City of Buenos Aires,31155,Argentina,Buenos Aires,C40,2013,Other: Proprietary methodology,"Even though the City used a proprietary methodology, with the assistance of private consultants, the International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI) was frequently consulted. 

It was elaborated by the Buenos Aires EPA, using the Ghree platform, provided by EMS software, which was developed by an external Consultancy Firm together with a National University.

The methodology for its preparation was divided into different stages:
-Obtaining selected information.
-The processing of the received data 
-Loading of data into software
-The conclusions drawn from this process.

In order to obtain the correct information, the EPA identified the different sectors to be included in the inventory and selected the accurate data to calculate GHG emissions. When identified the bodies responsible for providing the necessary information, the data was requested. 

Organizing information
The information was given in a hierarchical order that was organized as follows:
-Field (I.e. Community)
-Sector (I.e. energy consumption)
-Category (I.e. Power consumption)
-Sub category (I.e. Power consumption for residential)


To represent the GHG emissions produced within the Community sector the following categories were elected:

1. Energy consumption
2. Transport
3. Waste (Scope 3)
4. Water treatment (Scope 3)

1. Energy consumption
This category includes electricity, natural gas and diesel consumption. It is divided in 3 sub-categories: residential, commercial and industrial.

2. Transport
This category includes different means of transport, both private and public, which were considered representative at the time of accounting GHG emissions.

Private transport:
-Private cars (including vans), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.
-Duty traces (light and heavy), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.

Public transport:
-Buses, with diesel engines
-Taxis, including diesel and natural gas
-Subway, operating through electric power
-Trains, including those running with electric power as well as those using diesel engines.

3. Waste (Scope 3)
This category includes the amount of Municipal Solid Waste generated (taking into consideration residential and urban solid waste) in Buenos Aires during the reporting year, as well as its composition.
-food waste
-Pruning and garden waste
-Wood
-Textile
-Paper and cardboard
-Glass, plastic, metal and others.

4. Water treatment (Scope 3)
This category includes de energy consumed (KWh) for treating and providing drinkable water to the City. 

The data was processed using the software EMS, which calculates GHG emissions, converted to carbon dioxide equivalent using information on energy consumption (fuel, natural gas, electricity) for activities, emission factor, calorific power and density of energy used.

For the community inventory, the methodology used in the Energy Sector was the one used for the Government operation inventory. That is, stating the KWh/year consumed by the 3 sub categories, and multiplying by the emission factor of the grid. As for gas consumption, m3 of gas consumed, calorific power of natural gas, density of the gas and its emissions factor (IPCC 2006 default) were considered in the equation. 

For the private transport sector and buses, GHG emissions were calculated using the EMS software, which required, for each sub categories within the sector, the amount of circulating cars by type of fuel consumed and the amount and type of fuel sold in the city. Fuel consumed by industries and government’s fleet was subtracted to the amount of fuel sold leaving amount of fuel consumed by vehicles.

For the other public transport sector, trains and subways, GHG emissions were calculated from electricity and diesel consumed when travelling within the City. Kilometers travelled and energy consumption data was obtained from the National Regulatory Commission of transport, and Metrovías (Subway grant company). 

For the Waste sector, the methodology used was one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), “Tool to determine methane emissions avoided from disposal of waste at a solid waste of disposal site”. In order to apply this methodology, it was necessary to obtain both the amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in the City of Buenos Aires in each of the years considered in the inventory, as well as their composition. 

For the Water treatment sector, the energy consumed is calculated multiplying the amount of water supplied (m3) and the energy consumed per m3 of treated and distributed water.",2010-01-01 - 2010-12-31,9813932.71,"During the year 2009 the city developed the Climate Change Action Plan, together with the update of the GHG Inventory, during the period 2000-2008. The update was performed by Buenos Aires EPA, using for the general structure and for the transport sector in particular, the software Project 2 Degrees from the Clinton Foundation developed by Microsoft, Ascentium, ICLEI and CNT.

In December 2010, the City signed an agreement with a National University and a Consultancy firm, in order to update the Inventory. After a long process in order to collect, analyze and process the data, the City recalculated it´s GHG emissions for the period 2000-2010, using an improved methodology using ICLEI Local Government Protocol. 

According to last year questionnaire, we do not have updated values to report. As we have been working in methodology adjustments, you can see small differences in the Inventory results, but we are still reporting 2000-2010 emissions.

Regarding total GHG emissions evolution, we can see an increase of 8.8% for the whole period between 2000 and 2010. (See attached figure in Further Information section). 

However, in order to analyze annual changes there are several factors to take into consideration when analyzing GHG emissions in a city, such as demographic growth, commuters, temperature variations and economic fluctuation, among others. For example, the deep economic crisis that hit the country in 2001, causing a contraction in energy consumption (at a residential, commercial and industrial level), explain in part the observed decline in emissions between year 2000 and 2002, of around 4.9%. On the contrary, between 2005 and 2007 there have been a sharp increase in GHG emissions (around 8.3%), due among other reasons, to an increase in energy consumption because of high maximum temperatures during the summer and low minimum temperatures during the winter.

That is why, even though we do not have updated values to report, the city have done a thorough analysis in order to identify key sectors which might have an important effect on GHG emissions.
