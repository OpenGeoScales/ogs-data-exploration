These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry.
GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. 
GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases.
A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration.
GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay,  For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.

The project team developing the Inventory also participated in the international pilot study implementing and improving the GPC methodology.  
The GPC Pilot Version 1.0 (May 2012) methodology is derived from the National Inventory accounting guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, however, it is different to National Inventory reporting (which assesses direct emissions across  New Zealand). The community Inventory assesses both direct (production-based) emission sources within the geographic area (Scope 1) and indirect (consumption-based) emission sources associated with goods and services imported into the geographic area, such as electricity from the national grid, transport into the area that originates outside the area, and imported waste (Scope 2 and 3). The GPC methodology follows emerging international best practice. 
Due to the differences in methodological approach, the Regional, City and Districts absolute and per capita emissions cannot be compared directly to the absolute and per capita emissions reported in the New Zealand National GHG Inventory or emissions accounted for under the national Emissions Trading Scheme. However relative trends and the significance of individual emissions sources can still be compared in many cases.    
 
Even though the GPC methodology was in a pilot phase during the development of this report, we anticipate the GPC to become the accepted international standard for community Inventory development.

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.    The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.","(38.049365, -122.1585777)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

This method shows only the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the city but it does not include the impact of external electricity trade. Therefore, the consumption of final energy consumers is not reflected. That is why Berlin prefers method (2) which is a consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions. This methodology of calculating CO2 emissions is based on data from the end-use sectors, and puts electricity imports into account. It also adds to the end-users’ emissions those produced by generation of electricity and district heating in the energy transformation sector. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions is therefore one indicator to find out the end-users’ emissions in a region.
The calculation is based on the energy balance as comprehensive and complete presentation of the energy consumption as a basis.

 Compared to the base year 1990 Berlin has achieved a reduction of 27.4% CO2. The increases in CO2 emissions results from the manufacturing industry ( +9.2 %), air transport ( +13.6 %) and the area of household, commercial and services ( +6.6 %). The latter area is crucial. It accounted for additional emitted 0,916 million tons of CO2. The increases were mainly in the mineral fuels, gases, and district heating. Obviously, the demand for heating energy in 2010 was very pronounced. This can be explained by the harsh winter of 2010. The Berlin development has not been invulnerable to the national trend.

Citywide emissions include residential, commercial, and industrial activities as well as transportation and waste generation within city limits. Municipal emissions are embedded in the citywide inventory because municipal operations are within the city’s geographic boundaries.

There are multiple explanations for why Pittsburgh’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 28 percent between 2003 and 2008:
• Increased electricity usage
• Expanded transportation data to include all road types within Pittsburgh city limits
• More accurate natural gas combustion estimates using company-specific usage data and the actual number of natural gas customers • The inclusion of the Bellefield Boiler Plant’s commercial coal and natural gas combustion to produce steam in the Oakland area, excluded from 2003 data

The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.

Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory.

Greater Manchester,35898,United Kingdom,Manchester,,2015,01/31/2012 12:00:00 AM,Other:,"The primary emissions data is drawn directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012
DECC have not confirmed whether their data corresponds to the Global Protocol, however the methodologies appear very similar.",16145000,Increased,"Emissions have increased by just over 1 million tonned compared to the previous 12 months, but decreased overall by over 2 million tonnes overall since detailed records began in 2005. Key factors include weather variation (a much colder than usual spring and autumn led to extended heating days) and a spike in coal fired national power generation. National data would suggest a return to a decreasing trend in 2013 and 2014 due to  significant renewables coming on stream, and a better gas: coal balance in primary electricity generation.","(53.4575955, -2.1578377)","(55.378051, -3.435973)"
City of Seattle,16581,USA,Seattle,C40,2015,12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM,U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI),Please see detailed source notes throughout the inventory document.,5129000,Decreased,"This 2012 GHG inventory finds that the “core” emissions targeted by the Climate Action Plan -- have been similar in each of the four years analyzed: 1990, 2005, 2008, and 2012.  After accounting for GHG offsets purchased by Seattle City Light (for the small portion of fossil fuel based electricity in their portfolio), total core emissions have declined from approximately 3.8 million tons in 1990 to approximately 3.6 million tons in 2008 and 2012.    

This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008.

A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.","(47.6062095, -122.3320708)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"
