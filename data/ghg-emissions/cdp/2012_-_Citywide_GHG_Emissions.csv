"City of Portland, OR",14874,USA,"Portland, OR",C40,2012,2010,International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI),"Portland and Multnomah County gather data on carbon emissions to inform policy and programmatic decisions and to monitor overall progress toward emission goals. In general, the methodology follows guidelines developed by ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability and uses the Clean Air and Climate Protection software developed jointly by ICLEI and STAPPA/ALAPCO.
 
The Multnomah County inventory includes all emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, fuel oil (distillate and residual), propane, gasoline, diesel and solid waste disposal. These sources are discussed in further detail below.

Electricity is distributed to customers in Multnomah County by Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power (PP). Both PGE and PP provide data on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) sold to their distribution customers in each of three sectors: residential, commercial and industrial. Because these total numbers include sales of “green power” (i.e., power generated from sources that do not emit carbon emissions) to customers who have elected to purchase such power, these numbers are adjusted to determine how many kWh were sold to customers in Multnomah County from the utilities’ standard sources.
To calculate the carbon emissions from grid power, the inventory uses emission factors provided by eGRID for the Northwest Power Pool of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

NW Natural, the sole natural gas utility for Multnomah County, provides data on the total therms used in the county by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The carbon emissions attributable to natural gas usage are calculated by multiplying the total number of therms by the conversion factor provided by ICLEI for converting therms to CO2-e. 

Fuel oil data are taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Report” contained in the Petroleum Supply Annual (EIA Report), which publishes data on the sales in Oregon of heating oil, propane and kerosene. Figures are broken down in the three residential, commercial and industrial customer classes. In the absence of more specific information about usage in Multnomah County, the inventory assigns the county a share based on the percent of Oregon’s population living in Multnomah County. ICLEI provides conversion factors for carbon emissions associated with each of these heating fuels. The carbon emissions from these fuels attributable to Multnomah County are calculated by multiplying the total amount of each fuel by the applicable conversion factor.

Emissions from gasoline are calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Multnomah County. The State of Oregon, which collects a county gas tax on behalf of Multnomah County, issues quarterly reports detailing the total gallons of gasoline sold in the county. Gasoline sales provide an imperfect measure, since clearly some people who drive in Multnomah County purchase gasoline outside of the county while others purchase it in the county but drive elsewhere. 

The EIA Report contains data for the sales in Oregon of diesel fuel and certain other transportation fuels used for rail, shipping, on-highway use, military uses and off -highway use. Because of the interstate and international character of air, rail and shipping, ICLEI recommends not attributing fuel used by these modes to a given locality, and the inventory excludes these. The inventory allocates to Multnomah County a share of Oregon’s total sales of diesel for on-highway and construction use according to population. 

Metro operates the solid waste transfer stations serving Multnomah County and provides data on the total tonnage of materials landfilled each year from the Metro region. The inventory assigns a share of the total tonnage to Multnomah County based on the percent of Metro population that is in Multnomah County. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducts studies to determine the composition of waste in Oregon landfills. Thus, it is possible to estimate the composition of waste buried in landfills that are attributable to Multnomah County.

Some landfills capture methane gas and flare it. For each landfill that receives waste from Metro, DEQ provides an estimate of the percentage of methane captured. Using ICLEI’s Clean Air and Climate Protection software, and based on the Metro tonnage data, DEQ waste composition studies and estimates of methane recapture rates, the inventory estimates the total amount of methane generated at landfills that is released into the atmosphere. Landfill emissions included in the inventory reflect the cumulative future methane emissions that can be expected from waste disposed in a given year, as opposed to the amount of actual methane emissions from landfills in that year.",7664696,"(45.52, -122.6819)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

These GHG protocols used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory are listed below, and were applied to each sector, as relevant and as discussed below for each emissions sector. 

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.

Emissions are commonly divided into three categories or “scopes”, as follows (World Resources Institute 2004):
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions, such as emissions from combustion of natural gas or in vehicles, where the emission occurs directly at the activity causing the emission.
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions, such as emissions associate with the consumption of electricity due to power plant emissions or methane emissions at a landfill that receives waste , where the emissions occur at a location separate from the activity causing the emission.

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not owned or controlled by the reporting jurisdiction, such as the emissions resulting from the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels.
The 2010 Regional GHG Inventory includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions (World Resources Institute 2004), including all direct and indirect emissions; Scope 3 emissions are not included.",33545577,"(41.8781136, -87.6297982)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

The inventory, so called Emissions Inventory Greenhouse Gas of Rio de Janeiro City and not, ""in Rio de Janeiro City,"" does not incorporate the emissions occurring in the geographical boundaries of the municipality, but those occurring under their responsibility. 

By the end of 2011, the GHG emissions inventory from the city of Rio de Janeiro report was adapted to enable its presentation/comparison according to the emerging global protocol for community-scale greenhouse gas inventories, which Global Basic Standard for Community GHG Inventories disaggregates the emissions in three different scopes:
Scope 1 includes all direct emissions of GHG within the geographical boundaries of the city.
Scope 2 includes indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of purchased electricity. These emissions are caused by the share of electricity consumption in the city of Rio de Janeiro that is generated outside the city.
Scope 3 includes some indirect GHG emissions not accounted in Scopes 1 and 2.

City of Toronto,31117,Canada,Toronto,C40,2012,2008,The International Basic Standard for Community-Scale GHG Emission Inventories (ICLEI/C40/WB),"Currently, Toronto’s emissions calculations focus on our major emissions sources – energy (heating and cooling), transportation (mobile sources), and waste.

a. Energy Heating and Cooling:
Electricity and natural gas consumption for some City Departments (ABCCDs) are monitored through the Facilities Management Division. Emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are applied to consumption data in order to arrive at a GHG emissions total. The City of Toronto’s emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are updated annually and based on the National Inventory Reports (Environment Canada); however, the City of Toronto adds a 10% transmission loss to the NIR figure.

b. Transportation: 
Data are collected and standardized only for car and truck traffic through the City using four main sources: 
o truck traffic counts of approximately 200 intersections throughout the city from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division
o accumulated traffic count data from years 1987 to 2004 from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division
o the number of Ministry of Transportation registered vehicles in the City, and;
o a Canadian standard developed by a Canadian consultant

The above traffic data is then used to calculate “vehicle kilometers traveled” (VKT) and the EPA’s Mobil 6.2 software is used to calculate total emissions from mobile sources.

c. Waste: 
Tonnages of waste and approximate waste compositions are used in mass balance equations in the calculation of emissions from landfills.",25100000,"(43.653226, -79.3831843)","(56.130366, -106.346771)"

Processing the received data.

The data was processed using the software EMS, which calculates GHG emissions, converted to carbon dioxide equivalent using information on energy consumption (fuel, natural gas, electricity) for activities, emission factor, calorific power and density of energy used.

For the community inventory, the methodology used in the Energy Sector was the one used for the Government operation inventory. That is, stating the KWh/year consumed by the 3 sub categories, and multiplying by the emission factor of the grid. As for gas consumption, m3 of gas consumed, calorific power of natural gas, density of the gas and its emissions factor (IPCC 2006 default) were considered in the equation. 

For the private transport sector and buses, GHG emissions were calculated using the EMS software, which required, for each sub categories within the sector, the amount of circulating cars by type of fuel consumed and the amount and type of fuel sold in the city. Fuel consumed by industries and government’s fleet was subtracted to the amount of fuel sold leaving amount of fuel consumed by vehicles.

For the other public transport sector, trains and subways, GHG emissions were calculated from electricity and diesel consumed when travelling within the City. Kilometers travelled and energy consumption data,  was obtained from the National Regulatory Commission of transport, and Metrovías (Subway grant company) 

For the Waste sector, the methodology used was one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), “Tool to determine methane emissions avoided from disposal of waste at a solid waste of disposal site”. In order to apply this methodology, it was necessary to obtain both the amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in the City of Buenos Aires in each of the years considered in the inventory, as well as their composition. 

For the Water treatment sector, the energy consumed is calculated multiplying the amount of water supplied (m3) and the energy consumed per m3 of treated and distributed water.",9258902.77,"(-34.6037232, -58.3815931)","(-38.416097, -63.616672)"

The methodology used was taken from the United Nations IPCC works. The area of calculation was: electricity and heat used, transport (public and individual), communal waste management, sewage treatment as well as carbon sequestration by soil and biomass. The emissions from electricity used were calculated by first collecting the information from the users and then multiplying it by an appropriate CO2 emissions indicator based on national energy mix in Poland. The same indicator was used for years 1990, 1995, 2000, while for the year 2007 the indicator was different. The emissions from heat were calculated using the data about production of heat from different types of fuel. Next, on the basis of CO2 emissions indicators for each kind of fuel the final calculation was done. The calculation for transport was divided in four categories: individual cars, pick-ups, lorries and public transport. For each of them different indicators of CO2 emissions were used, depending on the year of vehicle production as well as on the share in the modal split. With regard to waste management, the amount of waste and the way of dealing with it allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent. The amount and characteristics of communal sewage, as well as the way it was treated, allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent.",10727200,"(52.2296756, 21.0122287)","(51.919438, 19.145136)"

The sectors are similar to those used for the official Danish emission inventory (IPCC sectors), and include: collective power and heating, Individual heating, mobile sources, transportation and machinery, industrial processes, solvents, agriculture, land use, and waste depositing and wastewater.

Simplified generalizations of the equations used for emission calculations are used. These are based on the assumption that emissions of a given activity can be estimated using data descriptive for the size of the activity multiplied by an emission factor pr unit of activity. That is, the inventory is primarily based on scope-2 data on heat and power consumption and scope-1 data on road traffic. 

The method includes CO2-, CH4- and N2O-emission in the inventory. 

As for the national inventories the calculation is built into several levels (Tiers) with increased requirements for municipalities regarding data quality. Each municipality may use different tiers for different sectors depending on the data availability.

Tier 1 is mainly based on the Danish national greenhouse gas inventory data using appropriate distribution keys, in most cases the municipality's share of total population, for a given activity into municipality level.

City of San Francisco,31182,USA,San Francisco,C40,2012,2010,International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI),"Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Direct Access Electricity: The majority of electricity used by these sectors is purchased from PG&E. Exceptions to this are power for municipal operations provided by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission and  Direct Access power customers. A San Francisco specific electricity factor is then applied to the usage figures to determine CO2 emissions.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial Natural Gas: The residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal sectors of San Francisco purchase their natural gas from PG&E. The California Climate Action Registry stationary natural emission factors are applied to the activity data to determine tons of GHGs. CO2, N2O, and CH4 registry factors are combined into a single CO2e factor. Emission factors for natural gas are based on combustion only and do not include upstream methane leakage from extraction and distribution of natural gas.

Municipal Electricity (including MUNI fleet electricity): Electricity usage data for municipal operations is obtained from the SFPUC. The Community EF is applied.

Municipal natural gas usage: Natural gas is delivered by PG&E.

Intra-regional & SF Road Vehicles:The SF County Transportation Agency provides modeled VMT data from its SFCHAMP model that includes all travel within San Francisco and assigns half of the VMT associated with trips into or outside of SF. The other half is attributed to the source or destination city. Pass-thru VMT are excluded from the total. 

Guidance from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. CO2e emissions are provided by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District using the Air Resource Board’s EMFAC model database.  

Rail – Caltrain Diesel Fuel: Estimates on total system fuel usage are obtained as well as passenger data, specifically total ridership and number of de-boardings in San Francisco. The % of trips de-boarding in San Francisco is share of trips attributable to San Francisco. This percentage is then applied to the total fuel usage, and that amount of fuel is multiplied by the California Climate Action Registry CO2 factor for diesel from mobile sources to determine emissions.
 
Rail – BART Electricity: Market area data and total system power consumption was obtained; Transbay and Westbay ridership was considered attributable to San Francisco and was divided by total ridership to determine a market share % for San Francisco. This market share % is multiplied by total system power usage to determine the San Francisco share of power usage. 
  
Ferry – Diesel Fuel:Ferry data is an estimation of emissions from all Bay Area leisure and commuter ferries.

Community Wide Electricity Emissions Factor: Within the City and County of San Francisco there are three distinct sources of electricity. The first and largest is PG&E which currently serves all residential and the majority of commercial buildings. The second are a small classification of commercial customers who purchase their power directly from power providers; these are known as Direct Access Customers. The third set of customers is those that purchase from the municipal San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. Each of these electric providers has a different carbon factor which is applied to kWh consumer by their respective customers. For emissions estimates of the different resources that constitute the California Net System Power Mix, including coal, natural gas, hydro, nuclear, and renewable, staff used figures recently published by the California Public Utilities Commission. In addition, in order to take responsibility for emissions generated by in city power plants San Francisco also included the emissions from PG&E contracted electric power plants located within the City and County of San Francisco as part of the emissions profile of PG&E customers.

1) Local Generation: GHG emissions produced by major facilities located within San Francisco. 
2) Owned Generation: The total electricity used by the City and County of San Francisco for municipal government operations, primarily carbon free power from SFPUC’s Hetch Hetchy hydro electric system.
3) Imported Power: This includes electricity consumed by Direct Access customers. Since very little information is publicly available on the resources procured by ESPs for non-BART DA customers, SFE staff estimated an emissions factor for the rest of DA electricity for the California Energy Commission (CEC) annual “California Net System Power Mix” as a proxy for an average DA resource portfolio.
