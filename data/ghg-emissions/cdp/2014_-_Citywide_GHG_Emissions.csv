http://www.london.ca/residents/Environment/Energy/Documents/2012_Inventory_Report.pdf",2920000,"Total community energy use in London in 2012 was 52,800 terajoules, six percent above 1990 levels, but nine percent below the recent peak in 2007. Between 2007 and 2012, decreases in energy use were most noted for transportation (15 percent drop). 

In 2012, energy use per person in London was 12 percent below 1990 levels. The biggest improvements can be seen in transportation energy use per person, which was 17 percent lower than 1990. This may reflect the shift in vehicle use and vehicle preferences associated with the oil price spike of 2008, and the subsequent higher fuel prices above the $1.00 per litre range. The slow recovery from the economic recession could also account for some of the reduction in fuel use.

Residential energy use per person was also 17 percent below 1990 levels. This may be attributed to improvements in the energy efficiency of consumer appliances, space heating and cooling systems, home retrofits and new home construction. The unusually warm winter of 2012 also reduced the demand for space heating, with a seven percent difference noted between 2011 and 2012.

Energy use per person related to the local economy in 2012 was five percent lower than 1990. In recent years, energy use by local employers has dropped significantly; with energy use per person being 15 percent lower than it was at its peak in 2004. Part of this can be attributed to the slow recovery from the recession. However, local utilities such as London Hydro and Union Gas have also been increasing efforts to promote energy conservation and demand management with their business client base. As noted above, the unusually warm winter of 2012 also reduced the demand for space heating.

Total greenhouse gas emissions from London have decreased compared to the “peak” in 2005. In 2012, greenhouse gas emissions were 22 percent lower than 2005. In fact, London’s emissions in 2012 were 10 percent lower than the 1990 level used to benchmark emission reduction efforts. This is below the Kyoto Protocol objective (six percent below 1990) that Canada had previously committed to.
However, it is important to note that the unusually warm winter of 2012 also played a part in reducing emissions, and that emissions in 2013 are likely to be higher than 2012.

"City of Portland, OR",14874,USA,"Portland, OR",C40,2014,2012,US Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI),"Portland and Multnomah County gather data on carbon emissions to inform policy and programmatic decisions and to monitor overall progress toward emission goals. In general, the methodology follows guidelines developed by ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability and uses the Clean Air and Climate Protection software developed jointly by ICLEI and STAPPA/ALAPCO.
 
This inventory is for all of Multnomah County. The City of Portland is 79% of Multnomah County by population. The inventory includes all emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, fuel oil (distillate and residual), propane, gasoline, diesel and solid waste disposal. These sources are discussed in further detail below.

Electricity is provided to customers in Multnomah County by Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power (PP). Both PGE and PP provide data on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) sold to their distribution customers in each of three sectors: residential, commercial and industrial. Because these total numbers include sales of “green power” (i.e., power generated from sources that do not emit carbon emissions) to customers who have elected to purchase such power, these numbers are adjusted to determine how many kWh were sold to customers in Multnomah County from the utilities’ standard sources. To calculate the carbon emissions from grid power, the inventory uses emission factors provided by ICLEI for the Northwest Power Pool of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

NW Natural, the sole natural gas utility for Multnomah County, provides data on the total therms used in the county by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The carbon emissions attributable to natural gas usage are calculated by multiplying the total number of therms by the conversion factor provided by ICLEI for converting therms to CO2-e. 

Fuel oil data are taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Report” contained in the Petroleum Supply Annual (EIA Report), which publishes data on the sales in Oregon of heating oil, propane and kerosene. Figures are broken down in the three residential, commercial and industrial customer classes. In the absence of more specific information about usage in Multnomah County, the inventory assigns the county a share based on the percent of Oregon’s population living in Multnomah County. ICLEI provides conversion factors for carbon emissions associated with each of these heating fuels. The carbon emissions from these fuels attributable to Multnomah County are calculated by multiplying the total amount of each fuel by the applicable conversion factor.

Emissions from gasoline are calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Multnomah County. The State of Oregon, which collects a county gas tax on behalf of Multnomah County, issues quarterly reports detailing the total gallons of gasoline sold in the county. Gasoline sales provide an imperfect measure, since clearly some people who drive in Multnomah County purchase gasoline outside of the county while others purchase it in the county but drive elsewhere. 

The EIA Report contains data for the sales in Oregon of diesel fuel and certain other transportation fuels used for rail, shipping, on-highway use, military uses and off -highway use. Because of the interstate and international character of air, rail and shipping, ICLEI recommends not attributing fuel used by these modes to a given locality, and the inventory excludes these. The inventory allocates to Multnomah County a share of Oregon’s total sales of diesel for on-highway and construction use according to population. 

Metro, the regional government for the Portland area, operates the solid waste transfer stations serving Multnomah County and provides data on the total tonnage of materials landfilled each year from the Metro region. The inventory assigns a share of the total tonnage to Multnomah County based on the percent of Metro population that is in Multnomah County. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducts studies to determine the composition of waste in Oregon landfills. Thus, it is possible to estimate the composition of waste buried in landfills that are attributable to Multnomah County.

Some landfills capture methane gas and flare it. For each landfill that receives waste from Metro, DEQ provides an estimate of the percentage of methane captured. Using ICLEI’s Clean Air and Climate Protection software, and based on the Metro tonnage data, DEQ waste composition studies and estimates of methane recapture rates, the inventory estimates the total amount of methane generated at landfills that is released into the atmosphere. Landfill emissions included in the inventory reflect the cumulative future methane emissions that can be expected from waste disposed in a given year, as opposed to the amount of actual methane emissions from landfills in that year.",7511675,"Portland and Multnomah County emissions decreased by -3.49% from 2011.

Cmmercial sector electricity use decreased by -.56% and by about -3.6% from the industrial sector.  Natural gas usage decreased in all  three sectors, -8.5% for residential, -6.34% for commercial, and down 10.8% for the industrial sector.

Comune di Ferrara,36286,Italy,Ferrara,,2014,2007,Other:,"The Baseline Emissions Inventory (BEI) was created according to the methodological instrument made available by Emilia-Romagna Region, with the technical-scientific support of the ARPA (Regional Agency for the Prevention and the Environment) within the Climate Plans regional work group, in which the Municipality of Ferrara participates. 
The cognitive foundation for producing the inventory is represented by the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, created by the Emilia-Romagna Region and ARPA Emilia-Romagna, according to the standard methods of estimation recognised on an international level (IPCC, CORINAIR). To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. Initially created by the Lombardy Region in collaboration with the Piedmont Region, INEMAR has been managed by ARPA Lombardy since 2003, and since 2006 it has been developed in the context of an inter-regional cooperation that still sees the participation of Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, Apulia, Marche and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano.
In a suitable manual, the Emilia-Romagna Region defined, in a shared manner with the regional local bodies, the methods for the processing and breakdown at the Municipal level of the data from the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from 2007, a baseline reference year.
At the Municipal level, the breakdown of emissions were then made available within a software developed by ARPA Emilia-Romagna and based on the Inventory tool LAKS, created and financed with the contribution of the financial tool LIFE of the European Community within the European Project LIFE+ ""LAKS ‐ Local Accountability for Kyoto Goals"". This software was made available to the local bodies of the Emilia-Romagna Region to draft their own Climate Plans and Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP).
As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a ""top-down"" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level.
The overall picture of emissions of the Terre Estensi Association was built from the emissions inventory of the individual Municipalities of Ferrara, Masi Torello and Voghiera that constitute the Association, making the sum of the contributions of the three Municipalities. In line with the agreements within the Regional Work Group on Climate Plans, the year 2007 was chosen as a baseline reference year. The classification of the sources was created in accordance with the Cartesio Guidelines, which correspond with the ICLEI Protocol and ISO 14064. Emissions were subdivided by sector (e.g.: consumption and emissions of residential buildings, transports, waste, etc.), in accordance with the categories established by the Cartesio Guidelines and eventually adapted to the specific characteristics of the territory. Overall emissions of the territory were calculated based on estimates created by ARPA Emilia-Romagna as a breakdown of the Regional Inventory INEMAR. The territorial perimeter considered for the emissions inventory of the Terre Estensi Association was made of the sum of the territories of the three member Municipalities and thus referred to the Municipal administrative confines, considering all emissions within the geopolitical confines of the area in which each of the three Municipalities has jurisdiction. Even if the local administration can only have limited influence on certain types of activities, the analysis considers all activities that can influence greenhouse gas emissions in one territory. In line with European and regional methodological indications, excluded from the analysis are all systems included within the ETS (Emission Trade System), the exchange system of active emission quotas at the European level. In turn, direct and indirect emissions are subdivided in the main sectors responsible for energy consumption and thus for generating greenhouse gases. The Sectors considered for indirect emissions concern Residential and Service Sector, Industry (non-ETS), Transport, Waste, Agriculture, Local energy production, Other sources",1582605.13,,"(44.8357395, 11.6189949)","(41.87194, 12.56738)"

and New Jersey Transit (NJT) for its commuter rail and buses.
Data used to calculate fugitive and process CH4 and process N2O
from wastewater treatment were provided by DEP. CH4 emissions
were calculated based on the destruction of volatile material in
anaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration and
flow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet of
digester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solids
destroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the daily
nitrogen load discharged by each of the City’s 14 wastewater
treatment plant to the formula in the LGOP.

Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gas
collection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani-
tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exported
solid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi-
dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste and
applying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken from
EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from natural
gas distribution was calculated using data provided by National
Grid and ConEd. Fugitive SF6 from electricity distribution was cal-
culated using data provided by ConEd. 

All DSNY-managed municipal solid waste (residential and some
institutional solid waste) generated in New York City is exported to 
landfills by private contractor and waste-to-energy facilities by
DSNY. Fuel consumed by trains and trucks exporting solid waste
out of the city is calculated using data provided by DSNY detailing
the mass of waste transported, mode of transport, and distance
to each disposal facility. Fuel use was calculated by estimating
how many trucks and trains are needed to transport the waste,
and applying average fuel economy figures to the weighted aver-
age distance to receiving landfills.

Scope 3 aviation emissions were calculated using fuel use data
from the PANYNJ. Emissions coefficients in the LGOP were applied
to the total volume of jet fuel and aviation gasoline loaded onto

- ISO 14064-1 (Specification with guidance at the organizational level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals)

2) Calculation: 
Considering 2006 IPCC G/L as standard methodology, Seoul has applied domestic activity and basic Emission Factors of the guideline for calculation as well as basic city data (energy consumption, waste, etc.). Emissions of 6 major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6) stated in the Kyoto Protocol were calculated and Seoul applied Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the second Assessment Report from the IPCC. 

3) Classification of emission source: 
In large, the classification is based on the 2006 IPCC G/L classification system but the categories were integrated or specified according to the characteristics of the city of Seoul. Based on the range of Seoul's authority, emission sources were classified into Scope 1 (Direct emission) and Scope 2 (Indirect emission), in accordance with the local GHG calculation guidelines.  

4) Measurement: 
Activities are collected from the official statistics of the national government and are used as activity for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions by sector. Official statistics provided by the national government are released every year and include oil statistics, electricity statistics, and chronology regional energy statistics. Emission calculations such as Emission Factor, are mainly based on the IPCC Guideline.

3) Emissions from Waste Sector, which are sub-sectored in emissions by waste disposal in landfill, biological treatment and waste treatment / disposal of effluents.

GHG emissions by fuel consumption
Different concentrations of biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) were established by the national authority for the distribution of Automotive Gasoline and Diesel. These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry.
GHG emissions for electricity consumption
The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. 
GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents
Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide: Arrudas STP, located in Sabará / MG which receiving wastewater of Belo Horizonte and Contagem / MG; Onça STP located in Belo Horizonte and also receives a fraction of sewage Contagem / MG; Olhos D'Água STP and Minas Solidária STP, located in Belo Horizonte and receive exclusive city sewers. There are a fifth STP, ETAF Sarandi/Ressaca that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases.
Moreover, a fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration.
Only a fraction derived of Belo Horizonte was considered in all STP which emit methane and nitrous oxide:
Arrudas STP
The Arrudas STP employs an activated sludge system for wastewater treatment, which is an aerobic system generates a high volume of biological sludge. This biological sludge is taken to stabilization in anaerobic reactors equipped with flow meters and methane content of biogas. There are too a firing device for biogás treatment.
Onça STP, Olhos D’Água STP e Minas Solidária STP
These stations employ wastewater treatment UASB reactors for wastewater treatment, which is a system emitting methane and nitrous oxide. These STP not have flow meters and methane content of the biogas. 
Autodepuration of Sewage in water bodies
A portion of the sewage collected by the local utility is disposal without any treatment in any water bodies, and emits methane.
Sewage Treatment Not Collected
The amount of sewage that is collected by the local utility can be arranged in various ways.
GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste
Landfill
The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill in the municipality of Santa Luzia / MG (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed, as a measure of conservatism, that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere.
A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, GHG emissions due to waste disposal in landfill in a given year will be distributed in the following years, generating a passive emission, in decreasing order. For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.

estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet
vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting
facilities, and other operations.
 The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol (The Climate Registry 2009a). This
protocol provides guidance for preparing GHG inventories in California.
 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on

much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emissions inventories.
 CARB California Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data 1990–2006 (California Air Resources
Board 2010). CARB’s documentation provides background methodology, activity data, protocols,
and calculations used for California’s statewide inventory.
 CEC Inventory of California Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990 to 2004 (California
Energy Commission 2006). This inventory provides useful methodology and emission factors for
statewide GHG emissions inventorying.
 EPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2008 (U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency 2011). This inventory provides useful methodology and
emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying.
The LGOP employs the convention of categorizing local government emission sources as Scope 1
(direct), Scope 2 (indirect), and Scope 3 (other indirect). Although the LGOP is geared towards
municipal inventories, these same scope definitions apply to community inventories. The LGOP
defines these emissions as follows (California Air Resources Board et al. 2010).
 Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions (with the exception of direct CO2 emissions from biogenic
sources);
 Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of purchased or acquired
electricity, steam, heating, or cooling; and
 Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not under the control or
influence of the local government (or a community), such as the emissions resulting from the
extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, and transport‐related activities in
vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions were quantified and included in the Regional Inventory. For example, direct
building energy emissions associated with on‐site natural gas use are included in Scope 1 because
these emissions occur within each city and are subject to each respective city’s influence or control.",38717974,"Emissions have increased overall since the last inventory in 2004.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.",7579144,,"(39.2903848, -76.6121893)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

City of San Francisco,31182,USA,San Francisco,C40,2014,2012,International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI),"The methodology for each type of emissions is explained below:

Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Direct Access Electricity: 
The majority of electricity used by the Residential, Commercial and Industrial sectors of San Francisco is purchased from PG&E. Exceptions to this are power to municipal operations, which is provided by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission (detailed in the Municipal Inventory guidance), and the remaining Direct Access power customers.

Data is provided by PG&E and the SFPUC. Emissions from electricity are calculated by applying each electricity source’s unique carbon profile to the total MWh’s consumed by each supplier’s customers.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial and Municipal Natural Gas: 
The residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal sectors of San Francisco purchase their natural gas from PG&E. Data is provided by both PG&E and the SFPUC. The California Climate Action Registry stationary combustion natural gas emissions factor is applied to the activity data to determine tons of GHGs. The emission factor for natural gas is based on combustion only and does not include upstream methane leakage from extraction and distribution of natural gas.

Municipal Electricity (including MUNI fleet electricity): 
Electricity usage data for municipal operations is obtained from the SFPUC. The electricity EF is provided by the SFPUC and applied to the usage data to determine the CO2 emissions.

Intra-regional & SF Road Vehicles: 
All vehicle related VMT have been consolidated into one report.  SFCTA provides modeled VMT data from their SFCHAMP model that includes all trips made by passenger vehicles and trucks within San Francisco and assigns half of the VMT associated with trips into or outside of SF.  The other half is attributed to the source or destination city per MTC guidance.  Pass-thru VMT are excluded from the total.  This methodology follows MTC guidance.  Daily VMT are multiplied by 330 to account for total weighted annual VMT where weekend demand is less than weekday. The 2010 CHAMP model did not include emissions from buses or freight. 
CO2e emissions are provided by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District using the Air Resource Board’s EMFAC model database.  The emission factor varies by year based on fleet composition used in the model from the DMV and modeling assumptions.

The emission factors vary by year and were supplied by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District. They were derived using EMFAC.

Rail – Caltrain Diesel Fuel: 
Estimates on total system fuel usage are obtained as well as passenger data, specifically total ridership and number of de-boardings in San Francisco. The percentage of trips de-boarding in San Francisco is share of trips attributable to San Francisco. This percentage is then applied to the total fuel usage, and that amount of fuel is multiplied by the California Climate Action Registry CO2 factor for diesel from mobile sources to determine emissions.
 
Rail – BART Electricity: 
In order to estimate emissions from BART attributable to San Francisco market area, data and total system power consumption was obtained from BART staff. Transbay and Westbay ridership was considered attributable to San Francisco and was divided by total ridership to determine a market share % for San Francisco. This market share % was than multiplied by total system power usage to determine the San Francisco share of power usage. The total system power data is based on electric propulsion data from: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm. Emissions factor data is available from PG&E and is commonly published in internal/external reports on energy or GHG emissions.
  
Ferry – Diesel Fuel: 
Ferry data is an estimation of emissions from all Bay Area leisure and commuter ferries. Starting in 2009, the data for all 3 agencies included in SF’s inventory (City of Alameda, City of Vallejo, and Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District) is reported at: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm.  Mode type is ‘FB’.

MUNI – Diesel Fuel:
Estimates of diesel fuel used by the SF Municipal Transportation Authority (SFMTA) revenue fleet (buses) were obtained from the SFMTA. The biodiesel content was separated out and only the diesel portion was included in the inventory for diesel emissions calculations. 

Emissions were calculated per Equation TR.4.A.2. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Mobile Combustion of the U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Version 1.0, October 2012.

These GHG protocols used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory are listed below, and were applied to each sector, as relevant and as discussed below for each emissions sector. 

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying.

This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.

Emissions are commonly divided into three categories or “scopes”, as follows (World Resources Institute 2004):
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions, such as emissions from combustion of natural gas or in vehicles, where the emission occurs directly at the activity causing the emission.
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions, such as emissions associate with the consumption of electricity due to power plant emissions or methane emissions at a landfill that receives waste, where the emissions occur at a location separate from the activity causing the emission.

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not owned or controlled by the reporting jurisdiction, such as the emissions resulting from the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels.

This method shows only the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the city but it does not include the impact of external electricity trade. Therefore, the consumption of final energy consumers is not reflected. That is why Berlin prefers method (2) which is a consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions. This methodology of calculating CO2 emissions is based on data from the end-use sectors, and puts electricity imports into account. It also adds to the end-users’ emissions those produced by generation of electricity and district heating in the energy transformation sector. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions is therefore one indicator to find out the end-users’ emissions in a region.

Pittsburgh’s 2003 and 2008 citywide GHG inventories are bounded by Pittsburgh city limits. This is a necessary delimitation for a manageable analysis. One way Pittsburgh is working to address the exclusion of Pittsburgh’s suburb neighborhoods, ports, and airports from the 2008 Pittsburgh GHG inventory data is to expand our reduction strategies and activities to include those entities whenever possible, even if they are or will be measured under separate inventories, such as Allegheny County’s inventory process. 

The 2008 Pittsburgh citywide inventory includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions except fugitive emissions. The Scope 3 emissions included are those from waste generated within Pittsburgh city limits.

The reported emission values are rounded.",6000000.79,"In 2008, Pittsburgh’s CO2e emissions totaled 6.79 million tons, a 28 percent increase from adjusted 2003 emissions levels of 5.30 million tons CO2e. Thus, to effectively meet the Pittsburgh greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal set in the Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan, Version 1.0 as 20 percent below 2003 levels by 2023, Pittsburgh must now work to reduce its 2008 greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2.55 million tons CO2e from 2008 levels.  

There are multiple explanations for why Pittsburgh’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 28 percent between 2003 and 2008:
• Increased electricity usage
• Expanded transportation data to include all road types within Pittsburgh city limits
• More accurate natural gas combustion estimates using company-specific usage data and the actual number of natural gas customers • The inclusion of the Bellefield Boiler Plant’s commercial coal and natural gas combustion to produce steam in the Oakland area, excluded from 2003 data
• The inclusion of kerosene and fuel oil combustion, excluded from 2003 data
• The exclusion of sequestration factors while calculating solid waste emissions, thereby treating solid waste as an emitter rather than a sink
• Weather differences.","(40.4406248, -79.9958864)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

Wellington City Council,43937,New Zealand,Wellington,,2014,2012,Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) Pilot Version 1.0 (C40 and ICLEI),"The GHG Inventory for the Wellington Region follows the methodology outlined in the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) - Pilot Version 1.0. The project team developing the Inventory also participated in the international pilot study implementing and improving the GPC methodology.  
The GPC Pilot Version 1.0 (May 2012) methodology is derived from the National Inventory accounting guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, however, it is different to National Inventory reporting (which assesses direct emissions across  New Zealand). The community Inventory assesses both direct (production-based) emission sources within the geographic area (Scope 1) and indirect (consumption-based) emission sources associated with goods and services imported into the geographic area, such as electricity from the national grid, transport into the area that originates outside the area, and imported waste (Scope 2 and 3). The GPC methodology follows emerging international best practice. 
Due to the differences in methodological approach, the Regional, City and Districts absolute and per capita emissions cannot be compared directly to the absolute and per capita emissions reported in the New Zealand National GHG Inventory or emissions accounted for under the national Emissions Trading Scheme. However relative trends and the significance of individual emissions sources can still be compared in many cases.    
 
Even though the GPC methodology was in a pilot phase during the development of this report, we anticipate the GPC to become the accepted international standard for community Inventory development. Participating in the pilot study allows the experience of the Wellington Region’s Councils to contribute to the final version of the GPC. 
While the methodology is detailed in the main report, the following aspects are particularly worth noting:  
 Due to data limitations, the study does not assess emissions from international aviation and international shipping.  Due to data limitations, the study estimates Regional emissions from industrial product use by scaling national industrial emissions from product use on a population basis after removing large point sources.    The study accounts for forest carbon stock changes from afforestation, reforestation, deforestation and forest management (i.e. it applies land-use accounting conventions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change rather than the Kyoto Protocol).  It treats emissions from harvesting and deforestation as instantaneous rather than accounting for the longer-term emission flows associated with harvested wood products.   The study accounts for waste-related emissions from both open and closed landfills.    Emissions are expressed on a carbon dioxide-equivalent basis using the 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007.",1301739,"Reduced petrol use, electricity use and natural gas use.

Scope 3 defined as the life cycle emissions of the energy use):
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions from district heating and cooling system and other in-boundary fuel combustion for heating
•	scope 2 and 3 emissions of the house-hold electricity consumption within the community boundary
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions of use of gas for e.g. cooking
•	scope 2 and 3 emissions for electricity use in the transportation system (metro, commuter train and train) within the community boundary
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions for the fuel consumption from road traffic, non-road vehicles and shipping, and scope 1 emissions from aviation (within the landing and take-off cycle, i.e. up to 915m).

This means that scope 3 emissions from transportation of Stockholmers outside the community boundary is not included (but transportation of non-Stockholmers within the community boundary is included). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is one source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.

Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001 and Thermal Engineering Research Institute (Värmeforsk) in 2011. The reports are widely used and acknowledged in Sweden. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2007, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).

Energy statistics are collected from different sources. District heating and gas statistics are collected from the companies in charge, electricity statistics is compiled at, and collected from, Statistics Sweden. Emission from road transport is modelled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm, so that a large variety of vehicles, speeds, road types etc. are included. Non-road vehicle statistics derives from Statistics Sweden, marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions and energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Stockholm Hamnar (Ports of Stockholm), and further elaborated to account for the community of Stockholm only.

When organizing information, the information was given a hierarchical order as follows: 
-Field (I.e. Community) 
-Sector (I.e. energy consumption) 
-Category (I.e. Power consumption) 
-Sub category (I.e. Power consumption for residential).

Private transport:
-Private cars (including vans), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.
-Duty traces (light and heavy), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.

Public transport:
-Buses, with diesel engines
-Taxis, including diesel and natural gas
-Subway, operating through electric power
-Trains, including those running with electric power as well as those using diesel engines.

3. Waste (Scope 3)
This category includes the amount of Municipal Solid Waste generated (taking into consideration residential and urban solid waste) in Buenos Aires during the reporting year, as well as its composition.
-food waste
-Pruning and garden waste
-Wood
-Textile
-Paper and cardboard
-Glass, plastic, metal and others.

4. Water treatment (Scope 3)
This category includes de energy consumed (KWh) for treating and providing drinkable water to the City. 

The data was processed and GHG emissions were calculated and converted to carbon dioxide equivalent using information on energy consumption (fuel, natural gas, electricity) for activities, emission factor, calorific power and density of energy used.

That is, stating the KWh/year consumed by the 3 sub categories, and multiplying by the emission factor of the grid. As for gas consumption, m3 of gas consumed, calorific power of natural gas, density of the gas and its emissions factor (IPCC 2006 default) were considered in the equation. 

For the private transport sector and buses, GHG emissions were calculated taking into consideration, for each sub categories within the sector, the amount of circulating cars by type of fuel consumed and the amount and type of fuel sold in the city. Fuel consumed by industries and government’s fleet was subtracted to the amount of fuel sold leaving amount of fuel consumed by vehicles.

For the other public transport sector, trains and subways, GHG emissions were calculated from electricity and diesel consumed when travelling within the City. Kilometers travelled and energy consumption data was obtained from the National Regulatory Commission of transport, and Metrovías (Subway grant company). 

For the Waste sector, the methodology used was one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), “Tool to determine methane emissions avoided from disposal of waste at a solid waste of disposal site”. In order to apply this methodology, it was necessary to obtain both the amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in the City of Buenos Aires in each of the years considered in the inventory, as well as their composition. 

For the Water treatment sector, the energy consumed is calculated multiplying the amount of water supplied (m3) and the energy consumed per m3 of treated and distributed water.",9886932,"Last year we were still reporting GHG emissions for year 2010 as we had been working in methodology adjustments. This year we are pleased to update information as to December 2012. 

When comparing Community GHG emissions from year 2012 with the previous year, there is an increase in emissions. However, in order to analyze annual GHG emission changes in a city there are several factors to take into consideration when analyzing, such as demographic growth, commuters, temperature variations and economic fluctuation, among other.

During 2012, even though there has been a decrease in industrial activity, therefore reducing energy consumption, an increase in the total amount of fuel sold results in an increase of GHG emissions.","(-34.6037232, -58.3815931)","(-38.416097, -63.616672)"
