GHG emissions are accounted for in each module as well: In the power module GHG emissions from fuel combustion and fugitive emissions from fuels handling, in the form of Industrial Processes and Product Use, GHG emissions caused by industrial processes (use and transformation of raw materials through chemical and physical processes) and non-energy uses of carbon in fossil fuels, in the form of agriculture, forestry and other land uses are considered emissions and removals GHGs, and the different forms of carbon stored in all land types, and basically waste module GHG emissions generated by the decomposition of organic matter in solid and liquid waste.

City of Portland, OR;14874;USA;Portland, OR;C40;2012;2010;International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI);"Portland and Multnomah County gather data on carbon emissions to inform policy and programmatic decisions and to monitor overall progress toward emission goals. In general, the methodology follows guidelines developed by ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability and uses the Clean Air and Climate Protection software developed jointly by ICLEI and STAPPA/ALAPCO.
 
The Multnomah County inventory includes all emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, fuel oil (distillate and residual), propane, gasoline, diesel and solid waste disposal. These sources are discussed in further detail below.

Electricity is distributed to customers in Multnomah County by Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power (PP). Both PGE and PP provide data on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) sold to their distribution customers in each of three sectors: residential, commercial and industrial. Because these total numbers include sales of “green power” (i.e., power generated from sources that do not emit carbon emissions) to customers who have elected to purchase such power, these numbers are adjusted to determine how many kWh were sold to customers in Multnomah County from the utilities’ standard sources.
To calculate the carbon emissions from grid power, the inventory uses emission factors provided by eGRID for the Northwest Power Pool of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

NW Natural, the sole natural gas utility for Multnomah County, provides data on the total therms used in the county by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The carbon emissions attributable to natural gas usage are calculated by multiplying the total number of therms by the conversion factor provided by ICLEI for converting therms to CO2-e. 

Fuel oil data are taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Report” contained in the Petroleum Supply Annual (EIA Report), which publishes data on the sales in Oregon of heating oil, propane and kerosene. Figures are broken down in the three residential, commercial and industrial customer classes. In the absence of more specific information about usage in Multnomah County, the inventory assigns the county a share based on the percent of Oregon’s population living in Multnomah County. ICLEI provides conversion factors for carbon emissions associated with each of these heating fuels. The carbon emissions from these fuels attributable to Multnomah County are calculated by multiplying the total amount of each fuel by the applicable conversion factor.

Emissions from gasoline are calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Multnomah County. The State of Oregon, which collects a county gas tax on behalf of Multnomah County, issues quarterly reports detailing the total gallons of gasoline sold in the county. Gasoline sales provide an imperfect measure, since clearly some people who drive in Multnomah County purchase gasoline outside of the county while others purchase it in the county but drive elsewhere. 

The EIA Report contains data for the sales in Oregon of diesel fuel and certain other transportation fuels used for rail, shipping, on-highway use, military uses and off -highway use. Because of the interstate and international character of air, rail and shipping, ICLEI recommends not attributing fuel used by these modes to a given locality, and the inventory excludes these. The inventory allocates to Multnomah County a share of Oregon’s total sales of diesel for on-highway and construction use according to population. 

Metro operates the solid waste transfer stations serving Multnomah County and provides data on the total tonnage of materials landfilled each year from the Metro region. The inventory assigns a share of the total tonnage to Multnomah County based on the percent of Metro population that is in Multnomah County. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducts studies to determine the composition of waste in Oregon landfills. Thus, it is possible to estimate the composition of waste buried in landfills that are attributable to Multnomah County.

Some landfills capture methane gas and flare it. For each landfill that receives waste from Metro, DEQ provides an estimate of the percentage of methane captured. Using ICLEI’s Clean Air and Climate Protection software, and based on the Metro tonnage data, DEQ waste composition studies and estimates of methane recapture rates, the inventory estimates the total amount of methane generated at landfills that is released into the atmosphere. Landfill emissions included in the inventory reflect the cumulative future methane emissions that can be expected from waste disposed in a given year, as opposed to the amount of actual methane emissions from landfills in that year.";7664696.0;(45.52, -122.6819);(37.09024, -95.712891);2010-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the City is currently piloting this approach and intends to revise its accounting and reporting methodology for upcoming inventories. As reported in its September 2001 inventory, New York City has elected to include emissions from the transport of solid waste to landfills outside of the city in its community inventory, consistent with the inclusion of this source in the local government operations inventory (this source will likely be excluded from future inventories). Consistent with the forthcoming, draft International Basic Standard for Community-Scale GHG Emissions Inventories (ICLEI/C40/WB), New York City has also has elected to include emissions associated with the decomposition of solid waste exported outside of the city as part of its community emissions total. New York City used the waste commitment method for estimating GHG emissions from landfilled and converted solid waste - this differs from the first order decay method required by the The International Basic Standard for Community-Scale GHG Emission Inventories (ICLEI/C40/WB), which New York City will use for future GHG inventories.

This method shows only the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the city but it does not include the impact of external electricity trade. Therefore, the consumption of final energy consumers is not reflected. That is why Berlin prefers a method which is a consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions. This methodology of calculating CO2 emissions is based on data from the end-use sectors, and puts electricity imports into account. It also adds to the end-users’ emissions those produced by generation of electricity and district heating in the energy transformation sector.

ICLEI is expected to release a community inventory protocol in 2012, however, and may be utilized for future updates to the Chicago Region’s emissions inventory. These GHG protocols used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory are listed below, and were applied to each sector, as relevant and as discussed below for each emissions sector. 

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.

Emissions are commonly divided into three categories or “scopes”, as follows (World Resources Institute 2004):
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions, such as emissions from combustion of natural gas or in vehicles, where the emission occurs directly at the activity causing the emission.
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions, such as emissions associate with the consumption of electricity due to power plant emissions or methane emissions at a landfill that receives waste , where the emissions occur at a location separate from the activity causing the emission.

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not owned or controlled by the reporting jurisdiction, such as the emissions resulting from the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels.

The main methodological issue considered is the delimitation of the inventory scope, by restricting those sources whose emissions result only from socio-economic activities in the responsibility of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, considering that these are activities that may suffer interference municipal government. The inventory, so called Emissions Inventory Greenhouse Gas of Rio de Janeiro City and not, ""in Rio de Janeiro City,"" does not incorporate the emissions occurring in the geographical boundaries of the municipality, but those occurring under their responsibility. 

By the end of 2011, the GHG emissions inventory from the city of Rio de Janeiro report was adapted to enable its presentation/comparison according to the emerging global protocol for community-scale greenhouse gas inventories, which Global Basic Standard for Community GHG Inventories disaggregates the emissions in three different scopes:
Scope 1 includes all direct emissions of GHG within the geographical boundaries of the city.
Scope 2 includes indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of purchased electricity. These emissions are caused by the share of electricity consumption in the city of Rio de Janeiro that is generated outside the city.
Scope 3 includes some indirect GHG emissions not accounted in Scopes 1 and 2.
It is worth to mention that the standard used to develop this inventory reflects global best practice, with input from academia, WRI, and World Bank, and is believed to be consistent with emerging international standards such as those being discussed by ICLEI-C40 (of which Rio de Janeiro is a member of both).

City of Toronto;31117;Canada;Toronto;C40;2012;2008;The International Basic Standard for Community-Scale GHG Emission Inventories (ICLEI/C40/WB);"Currently, Toronto’s emissions calculations focus on our major emissions sources – energy (heating and cooling), transportation (mobile sources), and waste.

a. Energy Heating and Cooling:
Electricity and natural gas consumption for some City Departments (ABCCDs) are monitored through the Facilities Management Division. Emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are applied to consumption data in order to arrive at a GHG emissions total. The City of Toronto’s emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are updated annually and based on the National Inventory Reports (Environment Canada); however, the City of Toronto adds a 10% transmission loss to the NIR figure.

b. Transportation: 
Data are collected and standardized only for car and truck traffic through the City using four main sources: 
o truck traffic counts of approximately 200 intersections throughout the city from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division
o accumulated traffic count data from years 1987 to 2004 from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division
o the number of Ministry of Transportation registered vehicles in the City, and;
o a Canadian standard developed by a Canadian consultant

The above traffic data is then used to calculate “vehicle kilometers traveled” (VKT) and the EPA’s Mobil 6.2 software is used to calculate total emissions from mobile sources.

Processing the received data.

The data was processed using the software EMS, which calculates GHG emissions, converted to carbon dioxide equivalent using information on energy consumption (fuel, natural gas, electricity) for activities, emission factor, calorific power and density of energy used.

For the community inventory, the methodology used in the Energy Sector was the one used for the Government operation inventory. That is, stating the KWh/year consumed by the 3 sub categories, and multiplying by the emission factor of the grid. As for gas consumption, m3 of gas consumed, calorific power of natural gas, density of the gas and its emissions factor (IPCC 2006 default) were considered in the equation. 

For the private transport sector and buses, GHG emissions were calculated using the EMS software, which required, for each sub categories within the sector, the amount of circulating cars by type of fuel consumed and the amount and type of fuel sold in the city. Fuel consumed by industries and government’s fleet was subtracted to the amount of fuel sold leaving amount of fuel consumed by vehicles.

For the other public transport sector, trains and subways, GHG emissions were calculated from electricity and diesel consumed when travelling within the City. Kilometers travelled and energy consumption data,  was obtained from the National Regulatory Commission of transport, and Metrovías (Subway grant company) 

For the Waste sector, the methodology used was one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), “Tool to determine methane emissions avoided from disposal of waste at a solid waste of disposal site”. In order to apply this methodology, it was necessary to obtain both the amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in the City of Buenos Aires in each of the years considered in the inventory, as well as their composition. 

For the Water treatment sector, the energy consumed is calculated multiplying the amount of water supplied (m3) and the energy consumed per m3 of treated and distributed water.";9258902.77;(-34.6037232, -58.3815931);(-38.416097, -63.616672);2010-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

City of Warsaw;31185;Poland;Warsaw;C40;2012;2007;2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories;Warsaw prepared the inventory (more precisely, the calculation of carbon footprint)  in 2008, which covered the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2007. The methodology used was taken from the United Nations IPCC works. The area of calculation was: electricity and heat used, transport (public and individual), communal waste management, sewage treatment as well as carbon sequestration by soil and biomass. The emissions from electricity used were calculated by first collecting the information from the users and then multiplying it by an appropriate CO2 emissions indicator based on national energy mix in Poland. The same indicator was used for years 1990, 1995, 2000, while for the year 2007 the indicator was different. The emissions from heat were calculated using the data about production of heat from different types of fuel. Next, on the basis of CO2 emissions indicators for each kind of fuel the final calculation was done. The calculation for transport was divided in four categories: individual cars, pick-ups, lorries and public transport. For each of them different indicators of CO2 emissions were used, depending on the year of vehicle production as well as on the share in the modal split. With regard to waste management, the amount of waste and the way of dealing with it allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent. The amount and characteristics of communal sewage, as well as the way it was treated, allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent.;10727200.0;(52.2296756, 21.0122287);(51.919438, 19.145136);2007-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Exceptions to this are power for municipal operations provided by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission and  Direct Access power customers. A San Francisco specific electricity factor is then applied to the usage figures to determine CO2 emissions.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial Natural Gas: The residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal sectors of San Francisco purchase their natural gas from PG&E. The California Climate Action Registry stationary natural emission factors are applied to the activity data to determine tons of GHGs. CO2, N2O, and CH4 registry factors are combined into a single CO2e factor. Emission factors for natural gas are based on combustion only and do not include upstream methane leakage from extraction and distribution of natural gas.

Municipal Electricity (including MUNI fleet electricity): Electricity usage data for municipal operations is obtained from the SFPUC. The Community EF is applied.

Municipal natural gas usage: Natural gas is delivered by PG&E.

Intra-regional & SF Road Vehicles:The SF County Transportation Agency provides modeled VMT data from its SFCHAMP model that includes all travel within San Francisco and assigns half of the VMT associated with trips into or outside of SF. The other half is attributed to the source or destination city. Pass-thru VMT are excluded from the total. 

Guidance from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. CO2e emissions are provided by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District using the Air Resource Board’s EMFAC model database.  

Rail – Caltrain Diesel Fuel: Estimates on total system fuel usage are obtained as well as passenger data, specifically total ridership and number of de-boardings in San Francisco. The % of trips de-boarding in San Francisco is share of trips attributable to San Francisco. This percentage is then applied to the total fuel usage, and that amount of fuel is multiplied by the California Climate Action Registry CO2 factor for diesel from mobile sources to determine emissions.
 
Rail – BART Electricity: Market area data and total system power consumption was obtained; Transbay and Westbay ridership was considered attributable to San Francisco and was divided by total ridership to determine a market share % for San Francisco. This market share % is multiplied by total system power usage to determine the San Francisco share of power usage. 
  
Ferry – Diesel Fuel:Ferry data is an estimation of emissions from all Bay Area leisure and commuter ferries.

Community Wide Electricity Emissions Factor: Within the City and County of San Francisco there are three distinct sources of electricity. The first and largest is PG&E which currently serves all residential and the majority of commercial buildings. The second are a small classification of commercial customers who purchase their power directly from power providers; these are known as Direct Access Customers. The third set of customers is those that purchase from the municipal San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. Each of these electric providers has a different carbon factor which is applied to kWh consumer by their respective customers. For emissions estimates of the different resources that constitute the California Net System Power Mix, including coal, natural gas, hydro, nuclear, and renewable, staff used figures recently published by the California Public Utilities Commission. In addition, in order to take responsibility for emissions generated by in city power plants San Francisco also included the emissions from PG&E contracted electric power plants located within the City and County of San Francisco as part of the emissions profile of PG&E customers.

1) Local Generation: GHG emissions produced by major facilities located within San Francisco. 
2) Owned Generation: The total electricity used by the City and County of San Francisco for municipal government operations, primarily carbon free power from SFPUC’s Hetch Hetchy hydro electric system.
3) Imported Power: This includes electricity consumed by Direct Access customers.

1) Emissions from Stationary Sector Units, which are sub-sectored emissions in residential, commercial / institutional, industrial and power generation, essentially related to energy consumption profile in each building;

2) Emissions Sector Mobile Units, which are sub-sectored in emissions by road transport, rail and air, reflecting the energy matrix of the transport system deployed in the city;

3) Emissions from Waste Sector, which are sub-sectored in emissions by waste disposal in landfill, biological treatment and waste treatment / disposal of effluents.

GHG emissions by fuel consumption
Different concentrations of biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) were established by the national authority for the distribution of Automotive Gasoline and Diesel. These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry.
GHG emissions for electricity consumption
The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. 
GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents
Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide: Arrudas STP, located in Sabará / MG which receiving wastewater of Belo Horizonte and Contagem / MG; Onça STP located in Belo Horizonte and also receives a fraction of sewage Contagem / MG; Olhos D'Água STP and Minas Solidária STP, located in Belo Horizonte and receive exclusive city sewers. There are a fifth STP, ETAF Sarandi/Ressaca that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases.
Moreover, a fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration.
Only a fraction derived of Belo Horizonte was considered in all STP which emit methane and nitrous oxide:
Arrudas STP
The Arrudas STP employs an activated sludge system for wastewater treatment, which is an aerobic system generates a high volume of biological sludge. This biological sludge is taken to stabilization in anaerobic reactors equipped with flow meters and methane content of biogas. There are too a firing device for biogás treatment.
Onça STP, Olhos D’Água STP e Minas Solidária STP
These stations employ wastewater treatment UASB reactors for wastewater treatment, which is a system emitting methane and nitrous oxide. These STP not have flow meters and methane content of the biogas. 
Autodepuration of Sewage in water bodies
A portion of the sewage collected by the local utility is disposal without any treatment in any water bodies, and emits methane.
Sewage Treatment Not Collected
The amount of sewage that is collected by the local utility can be arranged in various ways.
GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste
Landfill
The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill in the municipality of Santa Luzia / MG (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed, as a measure of conservatism, that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere.
A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, GHG emissions due to waste disposal in landfill in a given year will be distributed in the following years, generating a passive emission, in decreasing order. For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.
Composting
BH also conducts composting for organic waste. These activities take place in the CTRS Rod BR-040 and may incur nitrous oxide and methane.

The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).

Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.

Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data).

The data in place right now is an estimate based on the previous year's data.

Community Light-Duty Vehicle (LDV) Emissions
Vancouver's LDV emissions for 1990 and 2008 were estimated using annual Vancouver gasoline sales (from tax proceeds data) multiplied by a correction factor and the gasoline emission factor.  A correction factor was applied recognizing that as the largest regional employment node and with many of the regional recreational facilities, considerably more people travel to Vancouver (and therefore purchase fuel here) from surrounding municipalities than leave it on a daily basis.  
 
The correction factor was determined using Vancouver's original (2005) methodology for estimating LDV GHG emissions which was grounded on real data from AirCare testing on vehicle mileage for 1993, 1996, 1999, and 2002.  While this original methodology was a robust approach, it had to be abandoned due to changes in Air Care testing after 2002.  In this original methodology, Vancouver's share of regional gasoline sales for any given year was determined from the ratio of the total mileage of vehicles registered and insured in Vancouver compared to the total mileage of vehicles registered and insured in the region.  
 
The correction factor for the current methodology was based on the ratio of Vancouver's share of regional fuel sales compared against actual fuel sales in Vancouver.  This approach resulted in a correction factor of 0.99 for 1990 (based on the ratio for 1993 which was closest year for which actual data was available) and 0.91 for 2008 (based on the average ratio for 1996, 1999, and 2002).


Community Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) Emissions
Vancouver’s 2012 HDV emissions were based on Metro Vancouver modelling in the  “2005 Lower Fraser valley Air Emissions Inventory & Forecast and Backcast-Full Report” .  This report included new VKT estimates from Translink’s regional transportation model that are applicable for 2005 but not necessarily at the local level for earlier years back to 1990.  

For 2005, Metro Vancouver apportioned greenhouse gas emissions for the spatial regions within the Canadian Lower Fraser Valley.  For 2005, the City of Vancouver was allocated 14.4% of the Metro Vancouver greenhouse gas emissions (11.3 of the Lower Fraser Valley).  

The percentage of HDV’s in the >=5,000kg weight class was only available for the Lower Fraser Valley(LFV). Therefore, the same percentage was applied to Vancouver with the assumption that that breakdown of HDV vehicles sizes was generally the same at the local and regional level.

For Denmark as a whole, one kilowatt-hour of electricity emitted an average of almost 17% less CO2 in 2011 than in 2010, and more than 21% less than in 2005. This drop is partly attributable to higher wind production as well as more use of biomass in combined heat and power production.

The series of municipal has been made for the period 1991 to 2009. The 2011 figures are thus preliminary based on projected data. The 2011 projection is based on available regional data or nation projections for the different sources.

The data from Statistics Norway is based on the Kyoto protocol methodology. There are thus no emissions from electricity used in Oslo, as there is no significant production of electricity in Oslo and that the Norwegian electricity grid is based on hydro power. The emission target  of reducing GHG emission with 50% from 1991 to 2030 is based on the assumption of direct emission of CO2, CH3 and N2O (scope 1)

Between 1991 and 2009, emissions increased by 13 percent to 1.32 million tons. Half of GHG emissions in Oslo in 2009 came from the transport sector, however the use of fossil fuels for heating also contributed to substantial emissions; stationary combustion accounted for 38 percent of emissions in 2009. The City Council then asked the national government to permit a local tax on heating oil in order to reach the city target of phasing out all oil heating by 2020. This was rejected, but we are expecting a better regulatory and investment scheme that allows for a more rapid phasing out of oil heating.
 
While total emissions increased in Oslo 1991-2009, emissions per capita declined by 9 percent. Oslo’s increased by more than 100,000 between 1991 and 2009. This has led to increased emissions from transport and energy; however most of the increase in energy use stems from electricity which does not lead to direct GHG emissions (i.e. scope 2). Thus, the main target for reducing GHG emissions is the transport sector. Since Oslo is a transport hub in central Norway, this is challenging. The main strategies have been to enhance public transport (investments, operations and traffic flow) and increased use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the urban region (today more than 4000 EVs and rapidly growing). 
 
Today, Oslo has relatively low emissions per capita compared to other Norwegian and Scandinavian cities; around 2.3 tons of CO2 equivalents per person in 2009. This is partly because there are no large industrial companies in the municipality, and that there is great use of hydropower. In addition, much of the demand for transport in Oslo is covered by public transport, walking and cycling, partly because of a dense urban structure.";;"Energy generation is district heating according to figure from Hafslund Varme for Oslo.

Stockholm includes the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O in the yearly inventory of CO2e emission within the community boundary. 

The total emissions for the community include (Scopes as defined in ""International standard for determining greenhouse gas emissions for cities"" Version 2.1 and ""Global protocol for community-scale greenhouse gas emissions (GPD)"" Pilot Version 1.0):
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions from district heating and cooling system and other in-boundary fuel combustion for heating
•	scope 2 and 3 emissions of the house-hold electricity consumption within the community boundary
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions of use of gas for e.g. cooking
•	scope 2 and 3 emissions for electricity use in the transportation system (metro, commuter train and train) within the community boundary
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions for the fuel consumption from road traffic, non-road vehicles and shipping, and scope 1 emissions from aviation (within the landing and take-off cycle, i.e. up to 915m).

This means that scope 3 emissions from transportation of Stockholmers outside the community boundary is not included (but transportation of non-Stockholmers within the community boundary is included). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.

Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001. The report is widely used and acknowledged in Sweden. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2007, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).

Energy statistics are collected from different sources. District heating and gas statistics are collected from the companies in charge, electricity statistics is compiled at, and collected from, Statistics Sweden. Emission from road transport is modelled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm, so that a large variety of vehicles, speeds, road types etc. are included. Non-road vehicle statistics derives from Statistics Sweden, marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions and energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Stockholm Hamnar (Ports of Stockholm), and further elaborated to account for the community of Stockholm only.

The emission model for the transportation sector was replaced during 2010, which led to higher estimations of the emissions from road transportation.

The area of calculation was: electricity and heat used, transport (public and individual), communal waste management, sewage treatment as well as carbon sequestration by soil and biomass. The emissions from electricity used were calculated by first collecting the information from the users and then multiplying it by an appropriate CO2 emissions indicator based on national energy mix in Poland. The same indicator was used for years 1990, 1995, 2000, while for the year 2007 the indicator was different. The emissions from heat were calculated using the data about production of heat from different types of fuel. Next, on the basis of CO2 emissions indicators for each kind of fuel the final calculation was done. The calculation for transport was divided in four categories: individual cars, pick-ups, lorries and public transport. For each of them different indicators of CO2 emissions were used, depending on the year of vehicle production as well as on the share in the modal split. With regard to waste management, the amount of waste and the way of dealing with it allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent. The amount and characteristics of communal sewage, as well as the way it was treated, allowed to calculate the emissions of different GHG in CO2 equivalent. 
This methodology was used by the Institute for Sustainable Development while preparing the first Warsaw emission inventory - what resulted in number of 10 727 200 tonnes of CO2 for year 2007, which was reported in the previous edition of CDP. However, the latter calculations performed by the KAPE and NAPE energy agencies for purposes of Warsaw Sustainable Energy Action Plan used a slightly different methodology (including not counting absorption), following the SEAP guidelines from the Covenant of Mayors Office. The result equaled 12 952 984 tonnes for 2007.  First internal SEAP report, completed in second half of 2012, resulted in assessment of 13 304 435 tonnes of CO2 for 2011 (values given in points 1.4-1.8 are all for year 2011 - the corresponding values for 2012 are not available yet).";13304435.0;(52.2296756, 21.0122287);(51.919438, 19.145136);2007-01-01;;;;;2007-12-31;364 days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The slight overall increase of emissions in 2011 compared to 2007 was caused by the increased contribution from transport and electricity (while emissions connected with buildings and with heat decreased).

City of Portland, Oregon;14874;USA;Portland;C40;2013;2011-01-01 - 2011-12-31;Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) Pilot Version 1.0 (C40 and ICLEI);"Portland and Multnomah County gather data on carbon emissions to inform policy and programmatic decisions and to monitor overall progress toward emission goals. In general, the methodology follows guidelines developed by ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability and uses the Clean Air and Climate Protection software developed jointly by ICLEI and STAPPA/ALAPCO.
 
This inventory is for all of Multnomah County. The City of Portland is 79% of Multnomah County by population. The inventory includes all emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, fuel oil (distillate and residual), propane, gasoline, diesel and solid waste disposal. These sources are discussed in further detail below.

Electricity is provided to customers in Multnomah County by Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power (PP). Both PGE and PP provide data on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) sold to their distribution customers in each of three sectors: residential, commercial and industrial. Because these total numbers include sales of “green power” (i.e., power generated from sources that do not emit carbon emissions) to customers who have elected to purchase such power, these numbers are adjusted to determine how many kWh were sold to customers in Multnomah County from the utilities’ standard sources. To calculate the carbon emissions from grid power, the inventory uses emission factors provided by ICLEI for the Northwest Power Pool of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

NW Natural, the sole natural gas utility for Multnomah County, provides data on the total therms used in the county by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The carbon emissions attributable to natural gas usage are calculated by multiplying the total number of therms by the conversion factor provided by ICLEI for converting therms to CO2-e. 

Fuel oil data are taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Report” contained in the Petroleum Supply Annual (EIA Report), which publishes data on the sales in Oregon of heating oil, propane and kerosene. Figures are broken down in the three residential, commercial and industrial customer classes. In the absence of more specific information about usage in Multnomah County, the inventory assigns the county a share based on the percent of Oregon’s population living in Multnomah County. ICLEI provides conversion factors for carbon emissions associated with each of these heating fuels. The carbon emissions from these fuels attributable to Multnomah County are calculated by multiplying the total amount of each fuel by the applicable conversion factor.

Emissions from gasoline are calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Multnomah County. The State of Oregon, which collects a county gas tax on behalf of Multnomah County, issues quarterly reports detailing the total gallons of gasoline sold in the county. Gasoline sales provide an imperfect measure, since clearly some people who drive in Multnomah County purchase gasoline outside of the county while others purchase it in the county but drive elsewhere. 

The EIA Report contains data for the sales in Oregon of diesel fuel and certain other transportation fuels used for rail, shipping, on-highway use, military uses and off -highway use. Because of the interstate and international character of air, rail and shipping, ICLEI recommends not attributing fuel used by these modes to a given locality, and the inventory excludes these. The inventory allocates to Multnomah County a share of Oregon’s total sales of diesel for on-highway and construction use according to population. 

Metro, the regional government for the Portland area, operates the solid waste transfer stations serving Multnomah County and provides data on the total tonnage of materials landfilled each year from the Metro region. The inventory assigns a share of the total tonnage to Multnomah County based on the percent of Metro population that is in Multnomah County. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducts studies to determine the composition of waste in Oregon landfills. Thus, it is possible to estimate the composition of waste buried in landfills that are attributable to Multnomah County.

Some landfills capture methane gas and flare it. For each landfill that receives waste from Metro, DEQ provides an estimate of the percentage of methane captured. Using ICLEI’s Clean Air and Climate Protection software, and based on the Metro tonnage data, DEQ waste composition studies and estimates of methane recapture rates, the inventory estimates the total amount of methane generated at landfills that is released into the atmosphere. Landfill emissions included in the inventory reflect the cumulative future methane emissions that can be expected from waste disposed in a given year, as opposed to the amount of actual methane emissions from landfills in that year.";7773812.0;(45.5234515, -122.6762071);(37.09024, -95.712891);2011-01-01;;;;;2011-12-31;364 days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Portland and Multnomah County emissions increased by 1.6% from 2010. Overall emissions have declined since 1990, currently at -8.5% below 1990 levels. The increase from 2010 can largely be accounted for by increased use of electricty and natural gas from all sectors, in part as a result of a colder winter. Residential electricity use increased by about 1%, commercial by about 0.6% and industrial usage increased by 1.6%. Natural gas usage increased in all  three sectors, but primarily in the residential sector. However, total natural gas usage is still below 2008 levels. For transportation fuels, gasoline usage declined by 4%, but diesel fuel usage increased by 1%. Overall other fossil fuel usage increased by 12% from 2010, primarily driven by growth in the industrial sector.;;;;;;;;;;

ICLEI ‘s community inventory protocol which was not released at the time of the inventory may be utilized for future updates to the Chicago Region’s emissions inventory. These GHG protocols used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory are listed below, and were applied to each sector, as relevant and as discussed below for each emissions sector. 

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.

Emissions are commonly divided into three categories or “scopes”, as follows (World Resources Institute 2004):
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions, such as emissions from combustion of natural gas or in vehicles, where the emission occurs directly at the activity causing the emission.
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions, such as emissions associate with the consumption of electricity due to power plant emissions or methane emissions at a landfill that receives waste, where the emissions occur at a location separate from the activity causing the emission.

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not owned or controlled by the reporting jurisdiction, such as the emissions resulting from the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels.

City of Baltimore;35853;USA;Baltimore;;2013;2010-01-01 - 2010-12-31;Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI);"ICLEI’s methodology provides a systematic framework for local governments to track energy- and waste-related activities in the community, and to calculate the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by each activity and sector. The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.

Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.";7579144.0;(39.2903848, -76.6121893);(37.09024, -95.712891);2010-01-01;;;;;2010-12-31;364 days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This is our baseline year.

City of San Francisco;31182;USA;San Francisco;C40;2013;2011-01-01 - 2011-12-31;International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI);"Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Direct Access Electricity: 
The majority of electricity used by the Residential, Commercial and Industrial sectors of San Francisco is purchased from PG&E. Exceptions to this are power to municipal operations, provided by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission (detailed in the Municipal Inventory guidance) and remaining Direct Access power customers.

Emissions from electricity are calculated by applying each electricity source’s unique carbon profile to the total MWh’s consumed by each supplier’s customers.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial Natural Gas: 
The residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal sectors of San Francisco purchase their natural gas from PG&E. The California Climate Action Registry stationary natural emission factors are applied to the activity data to determine tons of GHGs. CO2, N2O, and CH4 registry factors are combined into a single CO2e factor. Emission factors for natural gas are based on combustion only and do not include upstream methane leakage from extraction and distribution of natural gas.

Municipal Electricity (including MUNI fleet electricity): 
Electricity usage data for municipal operations is obtained from the SFPUC. The electricity EF is provided by the SFPUC and applied to the usage data to determine the CO2 emissions.

Municipal natural gas usage: 
Natural gas is delivered by PG&E.

Intra-regional & SF Road Vehicles: 
All vehicle related VMT have been consolidated into one report.  SFCTA provides modeled VMT data from their SFCHAMP model that includes all trips made by passenger vehicles and trucks within San Francisco and assigns half of the VMT associated with trips into or outside of SF.  The other half is attributed to the source or destination city per MTC guidance.  Pass-thru VMT are excluded from the total.  This methodology follows MTC guidance.  Daily VMT are multiplied by 330 to account for total weighted annual VMT where weekend demand is less than weekday. The 2010 CHAMP did not include emissions from buses or freight. 
CO2e emissions are provided by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District using the Air Resource Board’s EMFAC model database.  The emission factor varies by year based on fleet composition used in the model from the DMV and modeling assumptions.

The emission factors vary by year and were supplied by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District. They were derived using EMFAC.

Rail – Caltrain Diesel Fuel: 
Estimates on total system fuel usage are obtained as well as passenger data, specifically total ridership and number of de-boardings in San Francisco. The % of trips de-boarding in San Francisco is share of trips attributable to San Francisco. This percentage is then applied to the total fuel usage, and that amount of fuel is multiplied by the California Climate Action Registry CO2 factor for diesel from mobile sources to determine emissions.
 
Rail – BART Electricity: 
In order to estimate emissions from BART attributable to San Francisco market area, data and total system power consumption was obtained from BART staff. Transbay and Westbay ridership was considered attributable to San Francisco and was divided by total ridership to determine a market share % for San Francisco. This market share % was than multiplied by total system power usage to determine the San Francisco share of power usage. The total system power data is based on electric propulsion data from: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm. Emissions factor data is available from PG&E and is commonly published in internal/external reports on energy or GHG emissions.
  
Ferry – Diesel Fuel: 
Ferry data is an estimation of emissions from all Bay Area leisure and commuter ferries. Starting in 2009, the data for all 3 agencies included in SF’s inventory (City of Alameda, City of Vallejo, and Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District) is reported at: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm.  Mode type is ‘FB’.

MUNI – Diesel Fuel:
Estimates of diesel fuel used by the SF Municipal Transportation Authority (SFMTA) revenue fleet (buses) were obtained from the SFMTA. The biodiesel content was separated out and only the diesel portion was included in the inventory for diesel emissions calculations. 

Emissions were calculated per Equation TR.4.A.2. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Mobile Combustion of the U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Version 1.0, October 2012. 

The Emission Factor used was from the California Climate Action Registry General Reporting Protocol Version 3.1, January 2009.";5058389.0;(37.7749295, -122.4194155);(37.09024, -95.712891);2011-01-01;;;;;2011-12-31;364 days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Overall emissions increased slightly, primarily due to the inclusion of diesel emissions from municipal buses due to newly available data. 

Sector emissions changed from the previous year due to the change in the way that emissions factors are used. Previously, a community-average emissions factor was calculated and applied to all sectors to calculate emissions. Emissions are now calculated using source-specific emission factors. Since the municipal electricity emissions factor is much lower than the utility emission factor, emissions from municipal electricity use dropped significantly from the previous year.";;;;;;;;;;

- Guidelines For Local Government Greenhouse Gas Inventories.,  Korea Environment Corporation, 2010
- ISO 14064-1 (Specification with guidance at the organizational level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals)

2) Calculation: 
Considering 2006 IPCC G/L as standard methodology, Seoul has applied domestic activity and basic Emission Factors of the guideline for calculation as well as basic city data (energy consumption, waste, etc.). Emissions of 6 major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6) stated in the Kyoto Protocol were calculated and Seoul applied Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the second Assessment Report from the IPCC. 

3) Classification of emission source: 
In large, the classification is based on the 2006 IPCC G/L classification system but the categories were integrated or specified according to the characteristics of the city of Seoul. Based on the range of Seoul's authority, emission sources were classified into Scope 1 (Direct emission) and Scope 2 (Indirect emission), in accordance with the local GHG calculation guidelines.  

4) Measurement: 
Activities are collected from the official statistics of the national government and are used as activity for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions by sector. Official statistics provided by the national government are released every year and include oil statistics, electricity statistics, and chronology regional energy statistics. Emission calculations such as Emission Factor, are mainly based on the IPCC Guideline.

More importantly, the department with the Mayor's help has increased it's renewable energy portfolio to 20% helping to reduce the emissions related to electricity.  The Mayor has also promoted cycling events to help people get excited about cycling and excercise.  
Another aspect to this decrease is the economy.  There is some question as the impact the down economy has played with the reduction of emissions.  Certainly people have driven less at times as there is less money in the wallets and gasoline prices rise.

The main methodological issue considered is the delimitation of the inventory scope, by restricting those sources whose emissions result only from socio-economic activities in the responsibility of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, considering that these are activities that may suffer interference municipal government. The inventory, so called Emissions Inventory Greenhouse Gas of Rio de Janeiro City and not, ""in Rio de Janeiro City,"" does not incorporate the emissions occurring in the geographical boundaries of the municipality, but those occurring under their responsibility. 

By the end of 2011, the GHG emissions inventory from the city of Rio de Janeiro report was adapted to enable its presentation/comparison according to the emerging global protocol for community-scale greenhouse gas inventories, which Global Basic Standard for Community GHG Inventories disaggregates the emissions in three different scopes:
Scope 1 includes all direct emissions of GHG within the geographical boundaries of the city.
Scope 2 includes indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of purchased electricity. These emissions are caused by the share of electricity consumption in the city of Rio de Janeiro that is generated outside the city.
Scope 3 includes some indirect GHG emissions not accounted in Scopes 1 and 2.
It is worth to mention that the standard used to develop this inventory reflects global best practice, with input from academia, WRI, and World Bank, and is believed to be consistent with emerging international standards such as those being discussed by ICLEI-C40 (of which Rio de Janeiro is a member of both).

City of Buenos Aires;31155;Argentina;Buenos Aires;C40;2013;2010-01-01 - 2010-12-31;Other: Proprietary methodology;"Even though the City used a proprietary methodology, with the assistance of private consultants, the International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI) was frequently consulted. 

It was elaborated by the Buenos Aires EPA, using the Ghree platform, provided by EMS software, which was developed by an external Consultancy Firm together with a National University.

The methodology for its preparation was divided into different stages:
-Obtaining selected information.
-The processing of the received data 
-Loading of data into software
-The conclusions drawn from this process.

In order to obtain the correct information, the EPA identified the different sectors to be included in the inventory and selected the accurate data to calculate GHG emissions. When identified the bodies responsible for providing the necessary information, the data was requested. 

Organizing information
The information was given in a hierarchical order that was organized as follows:
-Field (I.e. Community)
-Sector (I.e. energy consumption)
-Category (I.e. Power consumption)
-Sub category (I.e. Power consumption for residential)


To represent the GHG emissions produced within the Community sector the following categories were elected:

1. Energy consumption
2. Transport
3. Waste (Scope 3)
4. Water treatment (Scope 3)

1. Energy consumption
This category includes electricity, natural gas and diesel consumption. It is divided in 3 sub-categories: residential, commercial and industrial.

2. Transport
This category includes different means of transport, both private and public, which were considered representative at the time of accounting GHG emissions.

Private transport:
-Private cars (including vans), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.
-Duty traces (light and heavy), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.

Public transport:
-Buses, with diesel engines
-Taxis, including diesel and natural gas
-Subway, operating through electric power
-Trains, including those running with electric power as well as those using diesel engines.

3. Waste (Scope 3)
This category includes the amount of Municipal Solid Waste generated (taking into consideration residential and urban solid waste) in Buenos Aires during the reporting year, as well as its composition.
-food waste
-Pruning and garden waste
-Wood
-Textile
-Paper and cardboard
-Glass, plastic, metal and others.

4. Water treatment (Scope 3)
This category includes de energy consumed (KWh) for treating and providing drinkable water to the City. 

The data was processed using the software EMS, which calculates GHG emissions, converted to carbon dioxide equivalent using information on energy consumption (fuel, natural gas, electricity) for activities, emission factor, calorific power and density of energy used.

For the community inventory, the methodology used in the Energy Sector was the one used for the Government operation inventory. That is, stating the KWh/year consumed by the 3 sub categories, and multiplying by the emission factor of the grid. As for gas consumption, m3 of gas consumed, calorific power of natural gas, density of the gas and its emissions factor (IPCC 2006 default) were considered in the equation. 

For the private transport sector and buses, GHG emissions were calculated using the EMS software, which required, for each sub categories within the sector, the amount of circulating cars by type of fuel consumed and the amount and type of fuel sold in the city. Fuel consumed by industries and government’s fleet was subtracted to the amount of fuel sold leaving amount of fuel consumed by vehicles.

For the other public transport sector, trains and subways, GHG emissions were calculated from electricity and diesel consumed when travelling within the City. Kilometers travelled and energy consumption data was obtained from the National Regulatory Commission of transport, and Metrovías (Subway grant company). 

For the Waste sector, the methodology used was one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), “Tool to determine methane emissions avoided from disposal of waste at a solid waste of disposal site”. In order to apply this methodology, it was necessary to obtain both the amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in the City of Buenos Aires in each of the years considered in the inventory, as well as their composition. 

For the Water treatment sector, the energy consumed is calculated multiplying the amount of water supplied (m3) and the energy consumed per m3 of treated and distributed water.";9813932.71;(-34.6037232, -58.3815931);(-38.416097, -63.616672);2010-01-01;;;;;2010-12-31;364 days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The Green House Gases emissions attached in this section show the City´s total emissions, including Scope 3, as the City is working to reduce waste generation and water consumption.;;"During the year 2009 the city developed the Climate Change Action Plan, together with the update of the GHG Inventory, during the period 2000-2008. The update was performed by Buenos Aires EPA, using for the general structure and for the transport sector in particular, the software Project 2 Degrees from the Clinton Foundation developed by Microsoft, Ascentium, ICLEI and CNT.

In December 2010, the City signed an agreement with a National University and a Consultancy firm, in order to update the Inventory. After a long process in order to collect, analyze and process the data, the City recalculated it´s GHG emissions for the period 2000-2010, using an improved methodology using ICLEI Local Government Protocol. 

According to last year questionnaire, we do not have updated values to report. As we have been working in methodology adjustments, you can see small differences in the Inventory results, but we are still reporting 2000-2010 emissions.

Regarding total GHG emissions evolution, we can see an increase of 8.8% for the whole period between 2000 and 2010. (See attached figure in Further Information section). 

However, in order to analyze annual changes there are several factors to take into consideration when analyzing GHG emissions in a city, such as demographic growth, commuters, temperature variations and economic fluctuation, among others. For example, the deep economic crisis that hit the country in 2001, causing a contraction in energy consumption (at a residential, commercial and industrial level), explain in part the observed decline in emissions between year 2000 and 2002, of around 4.9%. On the contrary, between 2005 and 2007 there have been a sharp increase in GHG emissions (around 8.3%), due among other reasons, to an increase in energy consumption because of high maximum temperatures during the summer and low minimum temperatures during the winter.

That is why, even though we do not have updated values to report, the city have done a thorough analysis in order to identify key sectors which might have an important effect on GHG emissions. (See attached figure in Further Information regarding emissions breakdown)";;;;;;;;;;

Between 2007 and 2012, decreases in energy use were most noted for transportation (15 percent drop). 

In 2012, energy use per person in London was 12 percent below 1990 levels. The biggest improvements can be seen in transportation energy use per person, which was 17 percent lower than 1990. This may reflect the shift in vehicle use and vehicle preferences associated with the oil price spike of 2008, and the subsequent higher fuel prices above the $1.00 per litre range. The slow recovery from the economic recession could also account for some of the reduction in fuel use.

Residential energy use per person was also 17 percent below 1990 levels. This may be attributed to improvements in the energy efficiency of consumer appliances, space heating and cooling systems, home retrofits and new home construction. The unusually warm winter of 2012 also reduced the demand for space heating, with a seven percent difference noted between 2011 and 2012.

Energy use per person related to the local economy in 2012 was five percent lower than 1990. In recent years, energy use by local employers has dropped significantly; with energy use per person being 15 percent lower than it was at its peak in 2004. Part of this can be attributed to the slow recovery from the recession. However, local utilities such as London Hydro and Union Gas have also been increasing efforts to promote energy conservation and demand management with their business client base. As noted above, the unusually warm winter of 2012 also reduced the demand for space heating.

Total greenhouse gas emissions from London have decreased compared to the “peak” in 2005. In 2012, greenhouse gas emissions were 22 percent lower than 2005. In fact, London’s emissions in 2012 were 10 percent lower than the 1990 level used to benchmark emission reduction efforts. This is below the Kyoto Protocol objective (six percent below 1990) that Canada had previously committed to.
However, it is important to note that the unusually warm winter of 2012 also played a part in reducing emissions, and that emissions in 2013 are likely to be higher than 2012.

Greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity are significantly lower in 2012 (about 60 percent) than their peak in 2003.";;;;;;;;;;

City of Portland, OR;14874;USA;Portland, OR;C40;2014;2012;US Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI);"Portland and Multnomah County gather data on carbon emissions to inform policy and programmatic decisions and to monitor overall progress toward emission goals. In general, the methodology follows guidelines developed by ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability and uses the Clean Air and Climate Protection software developed jointly by ICLEI and STAPPA/ALAPCO.
 
This inventory is for all of Multnomah County. The City of Portland is 79% of Multnomah County by population. The inventory includes all emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, fuel oil (distillate and residual), propane, gasoline, diesel and solid waste disposal. These sources are discussed in further detail below.

Electricity is provided to customers in Multnomah County by Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power (PP). Both PGE and PP provide data on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) sold to their distribution customers in each of three sectors: residential, commercial and industrial. Because these total numbers include sales of “green power” (i.e., power generated from sources that do not emit carbon emissions) to customers who have elected to purchase such power, these numbers are adjusted to determine how many kWh were sold to customers in Multnomah County from the utilities’ standard sources. To calculate the carbon emissions from grid power, the inventory uses emission factors provided by ICLEI for the Northwest Power Pool of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

NW Natural, the sole natural gas utility for Multnomah County, provides data on the total therms used in the county by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The carbon emissions attributable to natural gas usage are calculated by multiplying the total number of therms by the conversion factor provided by ICLEI for converting therms to CO2-e. 

Fuel oil data are taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Report” contained in the Petroleum Supply Annual (EIA Report), which publishes data on the sales in Oregon of heating oil, propane and kerosene. Figures are broken down in the three residential, commercial and industrial customer classes. In the absence of more specific information about usage in Multnomah County, the inventory assigns the county a share based on the percent of Oregon’s population living in Multnomah County. ICLEI provides conversion factors for carbon emissions associated with each of these heating fuels. The carbon emissions from these fuels attributable to Multnomah County are calculated by multiplying the total amount of each fuel by the applicable conversion factor.

Emissions from gasoline are calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Multnomah County. The State of Oregon, which collects a county gas tax on behalf of Multnomah County, issues quarterly reports detailing the total gallons of gasoline sold in the county. Gasoline sales provide an imperfect measure, since clearly some people who drive in Multnomah County purchase gasoline outside of the county while others purchase it in the county but drive elsewhere. 

The EIA Report contains data for the sales in Oregon of diesel fuel and certain other transportation fuels used for rail, shipping, on-highway use, military uses and off -highway use. Because of the interstate and international character of air, rail and shipping, ICLEI recommends not attributing fuel used by these modes to a given locality, and the inventory excludes these. The inventory allocates to Multnomah County a share of Oregon’s total sales of diesel for on-highway and construction use according to population. 

Metro, the regional government for the Portland area, operates the solid waste transfer stations serving Multnomah County and provides data on the total tonnage of materials landfilled each year from the Metro region. The inventory assigns a share of the total tonnage to Multnomah County based on the percent of Metro population that is in Multnomah County. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducts studies to determine the composition of waste in Oregon landfills. Thus, it is possible to estimate the composition of waste buried in landfills that are attributable to Multnomah County.

Some landfills capture methane gas and flare it. For each landfill that receives waste from Metro, DEQ provides an estimate of the percentage of methane captured. Using ICLEI’s Clean Air and Climate Protection software, and based on the Metro tonnage data, DEQ waste composition studies and estimates of methane recapture rates, the inventory estimates the total amount of methane generated at landfills that is released into the atmosphere. Landfill emissions included in the inventory reflect the cumulative future methane emissions that can be expected from waste disposed in a given year, as opposed to the amount of actual methane emissions from landfills in that year.";7511675.0;(45.52, -122.6819);(37.09024, -95.712891);2012-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Portland and Multnomah County emissions decreased by -3.49% from 2011.

Cmmercial sector electricity use decreased by -.56% and by about -3.6% from the industrial sector.  Natural gas usage decreased in all  three sectors, -8.5% for residential, -6.34% for commercial, and down 10.8% for the industrial sector.

Comune di Ferrara;36286;Italy;Ferrara;;2014;2007;Other:;"The Baseline Emissions Inventory (BEI) was created according to the methodological instrument made available by Emilia-Romagna Region, with the technical-scientific support of the ARPA (Regional Agency for the Prevention and the Environment) within the Climate Plans regional work group, in which the Municipality of Ferrara participates. 
The cognitive foundation for producing the inventory is represented by the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, created by the Emilia-Romagna Region and ARPA Emilia-Romagna, according to the standard methods of estimation recognised on an international level (IPCC, CORINAIR). To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. Initially created by the Lombardy Region in collaboration with the Piedmont Region, INEMAR has been managed by ARPA Lombardy since 2003, and since 2006 it has been developed in the context of an inter-regional cooperation that still sees the participation of Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, Apulia, Marche and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano.
In a suitable manual, the Emilia-Romagna Region defined, in a shared manner with the regional local bodies, the methods for the processing and breakdown at the Municipal level of the data from the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from 2007, a baseline reference year.
At the Municipal level, the breakdown of emissions were then made available within a software developed by ARPA Emilia-Romagna and based on the Inventory tool LAKS, created and financed with the contribution of the financial tool LIFE of the European Community within the European Project LIFE+ ""LAKS ‐ Local Accountability for Kyoto Goals"". This software was made available to the local bodies of the Emilia-Romagna Region to draft their own Climate Plans and Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP).
As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a ""top-down"" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level.
The overall picture of emissions of the Terre Estensi Association was built from the emissions inventory of the individual Municipalities of Ferrara, Masi Torello and Voghiera that constitute the Association, making the sum of the contributions of the three Municipalities. In line with the agreements within the Regional Work Group on Climate Plans, the year 2007 was chosen as a baseline reference year. The classification of the sources was created in accordance with the Cartesio Guidelines, which correspond with the ICLEI Protocol and ISO 14064. Emissions were subdivided by sector (e.g.: consumption and emissions of residential buildings, transports, waste, etc.), in accordance with the categories established by the Cartesio Guidelines and eventually adapted to the specific characteristics of the territory. Overall emissions of the territory were calculated based on estimates created by ARPA Emilia-Romagna as a breakdown of the Regional Inventory INEMAR. The territorial perimeter considered for the emissions inventory of the Terre Estensi Association was made of the sum of the territories of the three member Municipalities and thus referred to the Municipal administrative confines, considering all emissions within the geopolitical confines of the area in which each of the three Municipalities has jurisdiction. Even if the local administration can only have limited influence on certain types of activities, the analysis considers all activities that can influence greenhouse gas emissions in one territory. In line with European and regional methodological indications, excluded from the analysis are all systems included within the ETS (Emission Trade System), the exchange system of active emission quotas at the European level. In turn, direct and indirect emissions are subdivided in the main sectors responsible for energy consumption and thus for generating greenhouse gases. The Sectors considered for indirect emissions concern Residential and Service Sector, Industry (non-ETS), Transport, Waste, Agriculture, Local energy production, Other sources";1582605.13;(44.8357395, 11.6189949);(41.87194, 12.56738);2007-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

and New Jersey Transit (NJT) for its commuter rail and buses.
Data used to calculate fugitive and process CH4 and process N2O
from wastewater treatment were provided by DEP. CH4 emissions
were calculated based on the destruction of volatile material in
anaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration and
flow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet of
digester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solids
destroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the daily
nitrogen load discharged by each of the City’s 14 wastewater
treatment plant to the formula in the LGOP.

Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gas
collection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani-
tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exported
solid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi-
dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste and
applying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken from
EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from natural
gas distribution was calculated using data provided by National
Grid and ConEd. Fugitive SF6 from electricity distribution was cal-
culated using data provided by ConEd. 

All DSNY-managed municipal solid waste (residential and some
institutional solid waste) generated in New York City is exported to 
landfills by private contractor and waste-to-energy facilities by
DSNY. Fuel consumed by trains and trucks exporting solid waste
out of the city is calculated using data provided by DSNY detailing
the mass of waste transported, mode of transport, and distance
to each disposal facility. Fuel use was calculated by estimating
how many trucks and trains are needed to transport the waste,
and applying average fuel economy figures to the weighted aver-
age distance to receiving landfills.

Scope 3 aviation emissions were calculated using fuel use data
from the PANYNJ. Emissions coefficients in the LGOP were applied
to the total volume of jet fuel and aviation gasoline loaded onto

Municipality of Belo Horizonte;35848;Brazil;Belo Horizonte;;2014;2014;Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) Pilot Version 1.0 (C40 and ICLEI);"In this inventory are presented the following issues:

1) Emissions from Stationary Sector Units, which are sub-sectored emissions in residential, commercial / institutional, industrial and power generation, essentially related to energy consumption profile in each building;

2) Emissions Sector Mobile Units, which are sub-sectored in emissions by road transport, rail and air, reflecting the energy matrix of the transport system deployed in the city;

3) Emissions from Waste Sector, which are sub-sectored in emissions by waste disposal in landfill, biological treatment and waste treatment / disposal of effluents.

GHG emissions by fuel consumption
Different concentrations of biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) were established by the national authority for the distribution of Automotive Gasoline and Diesel. These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry.
GHG emissions for electricity consumption
The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. 
GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents
Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide: Arrudas STP, located in Sabará / MG which receiving wastewater of Belo Horizonte and Contagem / MG; Onça STP located in Belo Horizonte and also receives a fraction of sewage Contagem / MG; Olhos D'Água STP and Minas Solidária STP, located in Belo Horizonte and receive exclusive city sewers. There are a fifth STP, ETAF Sarandi/Ressaca that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases.
Moreover, a fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration.
Only a fraction derived of Belo Horizonte was considered in all STP which emit methane and nitrous oxide:
Arrudas STP
The Arrudas STP employs an activated sludge system for wastewater treatment, which is an aerobic system generates a high volume of biological sludge. This biological sludge is taken to stabilization in anaerobic reactors equipped with flow meters and methane content of biogas. There are too a firing device for biogás treatment.
Onça STP, Olhos D’Água STP e Minas Solidária STP
These stations employ wastewater treatment UASB reactors for wastewater treatment, which is a system emitting methane and nitrous oxide. These STP not have flow meters and methane content of the biogas. 
Autodepuration of Sewage in water bodies
A portion of the sewage collected by the local utility is disposal without any treatment in any water bodies, and emits methane.
Sewage Treatment Not Collected
The amount of sewage that is collected by the local utility can be arranged in various ways.
GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste
Landfill
The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill in the municipality of Santa Luzia / MG (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed, as a measure of conservatism, that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere.
A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, GHG emissions due to waste disposal in landfill in a given year will be distributed in the following years, generating a passive emission, in decreasing order. For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.
Composting
BH also conducts composting for organic waste. These activities take place in the CTRS Rod BR-040 and may incur nitrous oxide and methane.

(listed in order of applicability for the inventory):
 CARB LGOP (California Air Resources Board et al. 2010). This protocol is the standard for
estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet
vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting
facilities, and other operations.
 The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol (The Climate Registry 2009a). This
protocol provides guidance for preparing GHG inventories in California.
 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change 2006). This document is the international standard for inventories and provides
much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emissions inventories.
 CARB California Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data 1990–2006 (California Air Resources
Board 2010). CARB’s documentation provides background methodology, activity data, protocols,
and calculations used for California’s statewide inventory.
 CEC Inventory of California Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990 to 2004 (California
Energy Commission 2006). This inventory provides useful methodology and emission factors for
statewide GHG emissions inventorying.
 EPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2008 (U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency 2011). This inventory provides useful methodology and
emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying.
The LGOP employs the convention of categorizing local government emission sources as Scope 1
(direct), Scope 2 (indirect), and Scope 3 (other indirect). Although the LGOP is geared towards
municipal inventories, these same scope definitions apply to community inventories. The LGOP
defines these emissions as follows (California Air Resources Board et al. 2010).
 Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions (with the exception of direct CO2 emissions from biogenic
sources);
 Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of purchased or acquired
electricity, steam, heating, or cooling; and
 Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not under the control or
influence of the local government (or a community), such as the emissions resulting from the
extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, and transport‐related activities in
vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions were quantified and included in the Regional Inventory. For example, direct
building energy emissions associated with on‐site natural gas use are included in Scope 1 because
these emissions occur within each city and are subject to each respective city’s influence or control.";38717974.0;(34.0522342, -118.2436849);(37.09024, -95.712891);2010-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Emissions have increased overall since the last inventory in 2004.

City of Baltimore;35853;USA;Baltimore;;2014;2010;Other: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI);"ICLEI’s methodology provides a systematic framework for local governments to track energy- and waste-related activities in the community, and to calculate the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by each activity and sector. The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.

Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.";7579144.0;(39.2903848, -76.6121893);(37.09024, -95.712891);2010-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

City of San Francisco;31182;USA;San Francisco;C40;2014;2012;International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI);"The methodology for each type of emissions is explained below:

Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Direct Access Electricity: 
The majority of electricity used by the Residential, Commercial and Industrial sectors of San Francisco is purchased from PG&E. Exceptions to this are power to municipal operations, which is provided by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission (detailed in the Municipal Inventory guidance), and the remaining Direct Access power customers.

Data is provided by PG&E and the SFPUC. Emissions from electricity are calculated by applying each electricity source’s unique carbon profile to the total MWh’s consumed by each supplier’s customers.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial and Municipal Natural Gas: 
The residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal sectors of San Francisco purchase their natural gas from PG&E. Data is provided by both PG&E and the SFPUC. The California Climate Action Registry stationary combustion natural gas emissions factor is applied to the activity data to determine tons of GHGs. The emission factor for natural gas is based on combustion only and does not include upstream methane leakage from extraction and distribution of natural gas.

Municipal Electricity (including MUNI fleet electricity): 
Electricity usage data for municipal operations is obtained from the SFPUC. The electricity EF is provided by the SFPUC and applied to the usage data to determine the CO2 emissions.

Intra-regional & SF Road Vehicles: 
All vehicle related VMT have been consolidated into one report.  SFCTA provides modeled VMT data from their SFCHAMP model that includes all trips made by passenger vehicles and trucks within San Francisco and assigns half of the VMT associated with trips into or outside of SF.  The other half is attributed to the source or destination city per MTC guidance.  Pass-thru VMT are excluded from the total.  This methodology follows MTC guidance.  Daily VMT are multiplied by 330 to account for total weighted annual VMT where weekend demand is less than weekday. The 2010 CHAMP model did not include emissions from buses or freight. 
CO2e emissions are provided by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District using the Air Resource Board’s EMFAC model database.  The emission factor varies by year based on fleet composition used in the model from the DMV and modeling assumptions.

The emission factors vary by year and were supplied by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District. They were derived using EMFAC.

Rail – Caltrain Diesel Fuel: 
Estimates on total system fuel usage are obtained as well as passenger data, specifically total ridership and number of de-boardings in San Francisco. The percentage of trips de-boarding in San Francisco is share of trips attributable to San Francisco. This percentage is then applied to the total fuel usage, and that amount of fuel is multiplied by the California Climate Action Registry CO2 factor for diesel from mobile sources to determine emissions.
 
Rail – BART Electricity: 
In order to estimate emissions from BART attributable to San Francisco market area, data and total system power consumption was obtained from BART staff. Transbay and Westbay ridership was considered attributable to San Francisco and was divided by total ridership to determine a market share % for San Francisco. This market share % was than multiplied by total system power usage to determine the San Francisco share of power usage. The total system power data is based on electric propulsion data from: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm. Emissions factor data is available from PG&E and is commonly published in internal/external reports on energy or GHG emissions.
  
Ferry – Diesel Fuel: 
Ferry data is an estimation of emissions from all Bay Area leisure and commuter ferries. Starting in 2009, the data for all 3 agencies included in SF’s inventory (City of Alameda, City of Vallejo, and Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District) is reported at: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm.  Mode type is ‘FB’.

MUNI – Diesel Fuel:
Estimates of diesel fuel used by the SF Municipal Transportation Authority (SFMTA) revenue fleet (buses) were obtained from the SFMTA. The biodiesel content was separated out and only the diesel portion was included in the inventory for diesel emissions calculations. 

Emissions were calculated per Equation TR.4.A.2. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Mobile Combustion of the U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Version 1.0, October 2012.

The GPC consists of a compilation of guidelines for the preparation of municipal inventories of GHG emissions. The GPC 2012 shares the terminology of various international programs reporting of emissions, including the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol (IEAP-ICLEI) and the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Moreover, GPC 2012 converses directly with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.
Aiming at a broad identification of emission sources and the establishment of a flow of information necessary for the completion of this study, four teams were created themes, being: stationary units, mobile units, and waste, industrial processes and product uses. The teams were grouped in four thematic workshops held between 26 and 27 June 2012 at the Administrative Center of the city of Goiania. During the implementation of these workshops were identified institutions and those responsible for sending the information necessary for calculations of emissions of greenhouse gases in the municipality.
For calculations of GHG emissions used the IPCC Inventory Software (IIS) version 2.0, a software developed and provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The data were placed on the software as a correspondence between GPC and IPCC categories, except in the case of the activities of electricity consumption (scope 2 emissions, the GPC category that has no corresponding IPCC - these emissions have been included in Section 5 - other).

ICLEI ‘s community inventory protocol which was not released at the time of the inventory may be utilized for future updates to the Chicago Region’s emissions inventory. These GHG protocols used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory are listed below, and were applied to each sector, as relevant and as discussed below for each emissions sector. 

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.

Emissions are commonly divided into three categories or “scopes”, as follows (World Resources Institute 2004):
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions, such as emissions from combustion of natural gas or in vehicles, where the emission occurs directly at the activity causing the emission.
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions, such as emissions associate with the consumption of electricity due to power plant emissions or methane emissions at a landfill that receives waste, where the emissions occur at a location separate from the activity causing the emission.

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not owned or controlled by the reporting jurisdiction, such as the emissions resulting from the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels.

There are two ways to look at energy-related CO2 emissions: (1) The calculation of carbon balance based on primary energy sources is subdivided by the sources of emissions, energy transformation and final energy consumption. This method shows only the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the city but it does not include the impact of external electricity trade. Therefore, the consumption of final energy consumers is not reflected. That is why Berlin prefers method (2) which is a consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions. This methodology of calculating CO2 emissions is based on data from the end-use sectors, and puts electricity imports into account. It also adds to the end-users’ emissions those produced by generation of electricity and district heating in the energy transformation sector. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions is therefore one indicator to find out the end-users’ emissions in a region.
The calculation is based on the energy balance as comprehensive and complete presentation of the energy consumption as a basis.

 Compared to the base year 1990 Berlin has achieved a reduction of 27.4% CO2. The increases in CO2 emissions results from the manufacturing industry ( +9.2 %), air transport ( +13.6 %) and the area of household, commercial and services ( +6.6 %). The latter area is crucial. It accounted for additional emitted 0,916 million tons of CO2. The increases were mainly in the mineral fuels, gases, and district heating. Obviously, the demand for heating energy in 2010 was very pronounced. This can be explained by the harsh winter of 2010. The Berlin development has not been invulnerable to the national trend.

City of Pittsburgh;35877;USA;Pittsburgh;;2014;2008;International Emissions Analysis Protocol (ICLEI);"Citywide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are defined as all emissions within the municipality’s geographic boundaries. Citywide emissions include residential, commercial, and industrial activities as well as transportation and waste generation within city limits. Municipal emissions are embedded in the citywide inventory because municipal operations are within the city’s geographic boundaries. 

The 2008 Pittsburgh Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory used ICLEI’s CACP software and Pittsburgh’s 2003 baseline Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory to guide citywide emissions inventorying in the absence of a formal citywide emissions reporting protocol. As with the municipal inventory, the data was converted to tons CO2e. 

Pittsburgh’s 2003 and 2008 citywide GHG inventories are bounded by Pittsburgh city limits. This is a necessary delimitation for a manageable analysis. One way Pittsburgh is working to address the exclusion of Pittsburgh’s suburb neighborhoods, ports, and airports from the 2008 Pittsburgh GHG inventory data is to expand our reduction strategies and activities to include those entities whenever possible, even if they are or will be measured under separate inventories, such as Allegheny County’s inventory process.

There are multiple explanations for why Pittsburgh’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 28 percent between 2003 and 2008:
• Increased electricity usage
• Expanded transportation data to include all road types within Pittsburgh city limits
• More accurate natural gas combustion estimates using company-specific usage data and the actual number of natural gas customers • The inclusion of the Bellefield Boiler Plant’s commercial coal and natural gas combustion to produce steam in the Oakland area, excluded from 2003 data
• The inclusion of kerosene and fuel oil combustion, excluded from 2003 data
• The exclusion of sequestration factors while calculating solid waste emissions, thereby treating solid waste as an emitter rather than a sink

Wellington City Council;43937;New Zealand;Wellington;;2014;2012;Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) Pilot Version 1.0 (C40 and ICLEI);"The GHG Inventory for the Wellington Region follows the methodology outlined in the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) - Pilot Version 1.0. The project team developing the Inventory also participated in the international pilot study implementing and improving the GPC methodology.  
The GPC Pilot Version 1.0 (May 2012) methodology is derived from the National Inventory accounting guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, however, it is different to National Inventory reporting (which assesses direct emissions across  New Zealand). The community Inventory assesses both direct (production-based) emission sources within the geographic area (Scope 1) and indirect (consumption-based) emission sources associated with goods and services imported into the geographic area, such as electricity from the national grid, transport into the area that originates outside the area, and imported waste (Scope 2 and 3). The GPC methodology follows emerging international best practice. 
Due to the differences in methodological approach, the Regional, City and Districts absolute and per capita emissions cannot be compared directly to the absolute and per capita emissions reported in the New Zealand National GHG Inventory or emissions accounted for under the national Emissions Trading Scheme. However relative trends and the significance of individual emissions sources can still be compared in many cases.    
 
Even though the GPC methodology was in a pilot phase during the development of this report, we anticipate the GPC to become the accepted international standard for community Inventory development. Participating in the pilot study allows the experience of the Wellington Region’s Councils to contribute to the final version of the GPC. 
While the methodology is detailed in the main report, the following aspects are particularly worth noting:  
 Due to data limitations, the study does not assess emissions from international aviation and international shipping.  Due to data limitations, the study estimates Regional emissions from industrial product use by scaling national industrial emissions from product use on a population basis after removing large point sources.    The study accounts for forest carbon stock changes from afforestation, reforestation, deforestation and forest management (i.e. it applies land-use accounting conventions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change rather than the Kyoto Protocol).  It treats emissions from harvesting and deforestation as instantaneous rather than accounting for the longer-term emission flows associated with harvested wood products.   The study accounts for waste-related emissions from both open and closed landfills.    Emissions are expressed on a carbon dioxide-equivalent basis using the 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007.";1301739.0;(-41.2864603, 174.776236);(-40.900557, 174.885971);2012-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Reduced petrol use, electricity use and natural gas use.

The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).

Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.

Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services.

City of Stockholm;3429;Sweden;Stockholm;C40;2014;2011;Other: City of Stockholm's standard. Developed in1996;"Greenhouse gas emissions inventory – The Stockholm proprietary method

Stockholm includes the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O in the yearly inventory of CO2e emission within the community boundary. 

The total emissions for the community include (Scope 1 and 2 as defined in ""International standard for determining greenhouse gas emissions for cities"" Version 2.1 and ""Global protocol for community-scale greenhouse gas emissions (GPD)"" Pilot Version 1.0”. Scope 3 defined as the life cycle emissions of the energy use):
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions from district heating and cooling system and other in-boundary fuel combustion for heating
•	scope 2 and 3 emissions of the house-hold electricity consumption within the community boundary
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions of use of gas for e.g. cooking
•	scope 2 and 3 emissions for electricity use in the transportation system (metro, commuter train and train) within the community boundary
•	scope 1 and 3 emissions for the fuel consumption from road traffic, non-road vehicles and shipping, and scope 1 emissions from aviation (within the landing and take-off cycle, i.e. up to 915m).

This means that scope 3 emissions from transportation of Stockholmers outside the community boundary is not included (but transportation of non-Stockholmers within the community boundary is included). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is one source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.

Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001 and Thermal Engineering Research Institute (Värmeforsk) in 2011. The reports are widely used and acknowledged in Sweden. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2007, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).

Energy statistics are collected from different sources. District heating and gas statistics are collected from the companies in charge, electricity statistics is compiled at, and collected from, Statistics Sweden. Emission from road transport is modelled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm, so that a large variety of vehicles, speeds, road types etc. are included. Non-road vehicle statistics derives from Statistics Sweden, marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions and energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Stockholm Hamnar (Ports of Stockholm), and further elaborated to account for the community of Stockholm only.

The latest revision of the methodology for greenhouse gas emission inventory in the City of Stockholm has been approved by the Envionment and Health Administrations political board.";2742000.0;(59.3293235, 18.0685808);(60.128161, 18.643501);2011-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Total emissions from the categories in Stockholm estimates at system boundaries have been reduced significantly over the past 10 years. Meanwhile , the population has grown by about 200 000 inhabitants. In Stockholm, it can be said that the reduction in per capita emissions by half will depend on the actual response , half of the population growth .

The 2013 follow-up of greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is estimated at 3.0 tonnes per capita in 2012. The estimates are preliminary and based on forecasted values. Calculated values for the 2011 greenhouse gas emissions, based on available statistics and modeling, is 3.2 tonnes per capita .
Energy use for heating has decreased in 2012, which is probably due to energy efficiency measures and conversions ( from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. The use of gas in the city decreases. Electricity use is however quite constant. There has been a large reduction in car traffic and a slight increase in the share of light trucks.
In the category of passenger cars have petrol car proportion dropped in favor of gas and ethanol cars, but most of all diesel cars. Diesel passenger cars consist increasingly of environmentally rated efficient diesel cars. Along with the decrease in transport activity ,this leads to strong overall emission reductions in the transport sector.
The preliminary figures show that 2015 target achieved already in 2012. But the variation is significant from year to year, depending on the rainfall situation and temperature.";;;;;;;;;;

City of Buenos Aires;31155;Argentina;Buenos Aires;C40;2014;2012;Other: Propietary methodology;"The GHG emissions are calculated by the Buenos Aires EPA Climate Change team using, primarily, ICLEI methodology. The methodology for its preparation was divided into different stages: 

-Obtaining selected information. 
-Processing of the received data 
-The conclusions drawn from this process. 

In order to obtain the correct information, the EPA identified the different sectors to be included in the inventory and selected the accurate data to calculate GHG emissions. When the bodies responsible for providing the necessary information were identified, the data was requested. 

When organizing information, the information was given a hierarchical order as follows: 
-Field (I.e. Community) 
-Sector (I.e. energy consumption) 
-Category (I.e. Power consumption) 
-Sub category (I.e. Power consumption for residential). 
To represent the GHG emissions produced within the Community sector the following categories were selected:

1. Energy consumption
2. Transport
3. Waste (Scope 3)
4. Water treatment (Scope 3)

1. Energy consumption
This category includes electricity, natural gas and diesel consumption. It is divided in 3 sub-categories: residential, commercial and industrial.

2. Transport
This category includes different means of transport, both private and public, which were considered representative at the time of accounting GHG emissions.

Private transport:
-Private cars (including vans), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.
-Duty traces (light and heavy), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.

Public transport:
-Buses, with diesel engines
-Taxis, including diesel and natural gas
-Subway, operating through electric power
-Trains, including those running with electric power as well as those using diesel engines.

3. Waste (Scope 3)
This category includes the amount of Municipal Solid Waste generated (taking into consideration residential and urban solid waste) in Buenos Aires during the reporting year, as well as its composition.
-food waste
-Pruning and garden waste
-Wood
-Textile
-Paper and cardboard
-Glass, plastic, metal and others.

4. Water treatment (Scope 3)
This category includes de energy consumed (KWh) for treating and providing drinkable water to the City. 

The data was processed and GHG emissions were calculated and converted to carbon dioxide equivalent using information on energy consumption (fuel, natural gas, electricity) for activities, emission factor, calorific power and density of energy used.

For the community inventory, the methodology used in the Energy Sector was the one used for the Government operation inventory. That is, stating the KWh/year consumed by the 3 sub categories, and multiplying by the emission factor of the grid. As for gas consumption, m3 of gas consumed, calorific power of natural gas, density of the gas and its emissions factor (IPCC 2006 default) were considered in the equation. 

For the private transport sector and buses, GHG emissions were calculated taking into consideration, for each sub categories within the sector, the amount of circulating cars by type of fuel consumed and the amount and type of fuel sold in the city. Fuel consumed by industries and government’s fleet was subtracted to the amount of fuel sold leaving amount of fuel consumed by vehicles.

For the other public transport sector, trains and subways, GHG emissions were calculated from electricity and diesel consumed when travelling within the City. Kilometers travelled and energy consumption data was obtained from the National Regulatory Commission of transport, and Metrovías (Subway grant company). 

For the Waste sector, the methodology used was one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), “Tool to determine methane emissions avoided from disposal of waste at a solid waste of disposal site”. In order to apply this methodology, it was necessary to obtain both the amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in the City of Buenos Aires in each of the years considered in the inventory, as well as their composition. 

For the Water treatment sector, the energy consumed is calculated multiplying the amount of water supplied (m3) and the energy consumed per m3 of treated and distributed water.";9886932.0;(-34.6037232, -58.3815931);(-38.416097, -63.616672);2012-01-01;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Last year we were still reporting GHG emissions for year 2010 as we had been working in methodology adjustments.

However, in order to analyze annual GHG emission changes in a city there are several factors to take into consideration when analyzing, such as demographic growth, commuters, temperature variations and economic fluctuation, among other.

During 2012, even though there has been a decrease in industrial activity, therefore reducing energy consumption, an increase in the total amount of fuel sold results in an increase of GHG emissions.";;;;;;;;;;

Three sources of emission were analysed: 
Stationary units: Emissions from residential buildings, commercial buildings and industrial consumption of electric energy (we did not include industrial processes since reliable information was not available).

Mobile units: emissions from transport units.

Waste: emissions from waste disposal and wastewater treatment.


GPC methodology allows for exclusion of information sources, in this case we have made the following exclusions:

-Emissions from leakage of refrigerants and fire suppression agents: Because of lack of enough information to estimate the amount of refrigerants and fire suppression agents used within the boundaries of the assessment.
-Direct emissions of SF6 leakage: because of lack of sufficient information to estimate the amount used.
-Direct emissions in industrial processes: Lack of sufficient to estimate emissions in the present report.
-Emissions from product use: Lack of sufficient information related to the consumption of products that emit GHGs within the limits of the evaluation.

Method of calculation details can be found at the GPC.

All data provided in this CDP submission is based on this report.
The process includes: A baseline data collection was collected from the following 5 sectors. Residential Sector: disaggregated according to electrified and non-electrified by income category. 
Commercial Sector: including retail and office buildings, tourism activities, education facilities, hospitals, and other non-industrial activities. Industrial Sector: disaggregated  into textiles, food and beverages, non-food manufacturing sub-sectors and other industrial activities. Local Government: all municipal operations, namely council buildings, street and traffic lights, water and wastewater treatment works and municipal vehicle fleet. Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train)

The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors.

In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor).

Total greenhouse gas emissions from London have decreased compared to the peak in 2007. In 2013, greenhouse gas emissions were 18 percent lower than 2007. In fact, London's emissions in 2013 were seven percent lower than the 1990 level used to benchmark emission reduction efforts. This is below the Kyoto Protocol objective (six percent below 1990) that Canada had previously committed to.
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity are significantly lower in 2013 (about 70 percent) than their peak in 2003. In 2013 only two percent of Ontario's electricity demand was generated by burning coal, and 11 percent was generated by burning natural gas. The rest of Ontario's electricity demand was met with emissions-free generation: 59 percent nuclear, 23 percent hydroelectric, 4 percent wind and other renewables.

Conservation and peak demand reduction programs also contribute to lower emissions from power generation. Unfortunately, lower demand from the economic slow-down in manufacturing sector also contributes to lower emissions.";;;;;;;;;;

Wellington City Council;43937;New Zealand;Wellington;;2015;06/30/2013 12:00:00 AM;;"The GHG Inventory for the Wellington Region follows the methodology outlined in the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GPC) - Pilot Version 1.0. The project team developing the Inventory also participated in the international pilot study implementing and improving the GPC methodology.  
The GPC Pilot Version 1.0 (May 2012) methodology is derived from the National Inventory accounting guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, however, it is different to National Inventory reporting (which assesses direct emissions across  New Zealand). The community Inventory assesses both direct (production-based) emission sources within the geographic area (Scope 1) and indirect (consumption-based) emission sources associated with goods and services imported into the geographic area, such as electricity from the national grid, transport into the area that originates outside the area, and imported waste (Scope 2 and 3). The GPC methodology follows emerging international best practice. 
Due to the differences in methodological approach, the Regional, City and Districts absolute and per capita emissions cannot be compared directly to the absolute and per capita emissions reported in the New Zealand National GHG Inventory or emissions accounted for under the national Emissions Trading Scheme. However relative trends and the significance of individual emissions sources can still be compared in many cases.    
 
Even though the GPC methodology was in a pilot phase during the development of this report, we anticipate the GPC to become the accepted international standard for community Inventory development. Participating in the pilot study allows the experience of the Wellington Region’s Councils to contribute to the final version of the GPC. 
While the methodology is detailed in the main report, the following aspects are particularly worth noting:

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.    The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.;;;;;;;;;;

City of Berlin;31153;Germany;Berlin;C40;2015;12/31/2010 12:00:00 AM;;"The balance of energy-related CO2 emissions is calculated according to a methodology agreed between the German states. There are two ways to look at energy-related CO2 emissions: (1) The calculation of carbon balance based on primary energy sources is subdivided by the sources of emissions, energy transformation and final energy consumption. This method shows only the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the city but it does not include the impact of external electricity trade. Therefore, the consumption of final energy consumers is not reflected. That is why Berlin prefers method (2) which is a consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions. This methodology of calculating CO2 emissions is based on data from the end-use sectors, and puts electricity imports into account. It also adds to the end-users’ emissions those produced by generation of electricity and district heating in the energy transformation sector. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions is therefore one indicator to find out the end-users’ emissions in a region.
The calculation is based on the energy balance as comprehensive and complete presentation of the energy consumption as a basis. In addition there are specific CO2 factors necessary based on the calorific value of an energy source offered by the Federal Environment Agency differentiated according to energy source and application.";21299000.0;(52.5200066, 13.404954);(51.165691, 10.451526);2010-12-31;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Increased;"The energy and CO2 balance for the year 2010 presented by the Office for Statistics Berlin-Brandenburg state significant increases of the final energy consumption ( FEC) and CO2 emissions compared with the year 2009. Final energy consumption compared to the previous year increased by 7.4% and CO2 emissions by 5.9%.
 Compared to the base year 1990 Berlin has achieved a reduction of 27.4% CO2. The increases in CO2 emissions results from the manufacturing industry ( +9.2 %), air transport ( +13.6 %) and the area of household, commercial and services ( +6.6 %). The latter area is crucial. It accounted for additional emitted 0,916 million tons of CO2. The increases were mainly in the mineral fuels, gases, and district heating. Obviously, the demand for heating energy in 2010 was very pronounced. This can be explained by the harsh winter of 2010. The Berlin development has not been invulnerable to the national trend.

Citywide emissions include residential, commercial, and industrial activities as well as transportation and waste generation within city limits. Municipal emissions are embedded in the citywide inventory because municipal operations are within the city’s geographic boundaries.

As with the municipal inventory, the data was converted to tons CO2e. 

Pittsburgh’s 2003 and 2008 citywide GHG inventories are bounded by Pittsburgh city limits. This is a necessary delimitation for a manageable analysis. One way Pittsburgh is working to address the exclusion of Pittsburgh’s suburb neighborhoods, ports, and airports from the 2008 Pittsburgh GHG inventory data is to expand our reduction strategies and activities to include those entities whenever possible, even if they are or will be measured under separate inventories, such as Allegheny County’s inventory process.

There are multiple explanations for why Pittsburgh’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 28 percent between 2003 and 2008:
• Increased electricity usage
• Expanded transportation data to include all road types within Pittsburgh city limits
• More accurate natural gas combustion estimates using company-specific usage data and the actual number of natural gas customers • The inclusion of the Bellefield Boiler Plant’s commercial coal and natural gas combustion to produce steam in the Oakland area, excluded from 2003 data
• The inclusion of kerosene and fuel oil combustion, excluded from 2003 data
• The exclusion of sequestration factors while calculating solid waste emissions, thereby treating solid waste as an emitter rather than a sink

Based on this prediction, the 30% reduction would need to be   approximately 35,24 million tons of CO2e / year. To support the reduction commitment, the following  mitigation strategies will be applied:

Implement energy savings and increase the utilization of environmentally-friendly alternative energy.

Simplified generalizations of the equations used for emission calculations are used. These are based on the assumption that emissions of a given activity can be estimated using data descriptive for the size of the activity multiplied by an emission factor pr unit or activity. That is, the inventory is primarily based on scope-2 data on heat and power consumption and scope-1 data on road traffic.

The method includes CO2-, CH4- and N2O-emission in the inventory.

Considering 2006 IPCC G/L as standard methodology, Seoul has applied domestic activity and basic Emission Factors of the guideline for calculation as well as basic city data (energy consumption, waste, etc.). Emissions of 6 major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6) stated in the Kyoto Protocol were calculated and Seoul applied Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the second Assessment Report from the IPCC. 

3) Classification of emission source: 
In large, the classification is based on the 2006 IPCC G/L classification system but the categories were integrated or specified according to the characteristics of the city of Seoul. Based on the range of Seoul's authority, emission sources were classified into Scope 1 (Direct emission) and Scope 2 (Indirect emission), in accordance with the local GHG calculation guidelines.  

4) Measurement: 
Activities are collected from the official statistics of the national government and are used as activity for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions by sector. Official statistics provided by the national government are released every year and include oil statistics, electricity statistics, and chronology regional energy statistics. Emission calculations such as Emission Factor, are mainly based on the IPCC Guideline.

The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.

Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory.

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

Second, increased demand for natural gas caused the price to increase and reduced availability. This led some power plants producing electricity and steam to reverse a trend of the past several years and increase their use of oil and coal, both of which produce more GHGs per unit of energy than natural gas. This change is reflected in the higher emissions factors for steam and electricity.";;;;;;;;;;

Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.

Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data).

To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels.

After accounting for GHG offsets purchased by Seattle City Light (for the small portion of fossil fuel based electricity in their portfolio), total core emissions have declined from approximately 3.8 million tons in 1990 to approximately 3.6 million tons in 2008 and 2012.    

This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008.

A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.";;;;;;;;;;

All data provided in this CDP submission is based on this report.
The process includes: A baseline data collection was collected from the following 5 sectors. Residential Sector: disaggregated according to electrified and non-electrified by income category. 
Commercial Sector: including retail and office buildings, tourism activities, education facilities, hospitals, and other non-industrial activities. Industrial Sector: disaggregated  into textiles, food and beverages, non-food manufacturing sub-sectors and other industrial activities. Local Government: all municipal operations, namely council buildings, street and traffic lights, water and wastewater treatment works and municipal vehicle fleet. Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train)

The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors.

In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor).

The GPC consists of a compilation of guidelines for the preparation of municipal inventories of GHG emissions. The GPC 2012 shares the terminology of various international programs reporting of emissions, including the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol (IEAP-ICLEI) and the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Moreover, GPC 2012 converses directly with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.
Aiming at a broad identification of emission sources and the establishment of a flow of information necessary for the completion of this study, four teams were created themes, being: stationary units, mobile units, and waste, industrial processes and product uses. The teams were grouped in four thematic workshops held between 26 and 27 June 2012 at the Administrative Center of the city of Goiania. During the implementation of these workshops were identified institutions and those responsible for sending the information necessary for calculations of emissions of greenhouse gases in the municipality.
For calculations of GHG emissions used the IPCC Inventory Software (IIS) version 2.0, a software developed and provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The data were placed on the software as a correspondence between GPC and IPCC categories, except in the case of the activities of electricity consumption (scope 2 emissions, the GPC category that has no corresponding IPCC - these emissions have been included in Section 5 - other).
Another category that deserves observation refers to the disposal of solid waste in landfills. For this category we used the GPC, which allocates all expected emissions inventory in the year in which the waste is landfilled, IIS was not used for the calculation of this emission source.";2016320.0;(-16.6868912, -49.2647943);(-14.235004, -51.92528);2010-12-31;;;;;;;Administrative boundary of a local government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;739.0;2173141.0;2010.0;749.0;23.2;30131330.0;BRL     Brazilian Real;2010.0;IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistical;

These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry.
GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. 
GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases.
A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration.
GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay,  For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.

As a result, overall natural gas use was up by eight percent in 2014 compared to 2013.

Total greenhouse gas emissions from London have decreased compared to the peak in 2007. In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions were 19 percent lower than 2007. In fact, London's emissions in 2014 were six percent lower than the 1990 level used to benchmark emission reduction efforts. This is below the Kyoto Protocol objective (six percent below 1990) that Canada had previously committed to.

Greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity are significantly lower in 2014 (about 80 percent) than their peak in 2003. In 2014, only 0.1 percent of Ontario's electricity demand was generated by burning coal as these plants were shut down, and 10 percent was generated by burning natural gas. The rest of Ontario's electricity demand was met with emissions-free generation: 62 percent nuclear, 24 percent hydroelectric, 4 percent wind and other renewables.

Conservation and peak demand reduction programs also contribute to lower emissions from power generation.

The sectors are similar to those used for the official Danish emission inventory (IPCC sectors), and include; collective power and heating, Indivitual heating, Mobile sources, Tranportation and machinery, Industrial processes, Solvents, Agriculture, Land use, and waste depositing and wastewater.

Simplified generalizations of the equations used for emission calculations are used. These are based on the assumption that emissions of a given activity can be estimated using data descriptive for the size of the activity multiplied by an emission factor pr unit or activity. That is, the inventory is primarily based on scope-2 data on heat and power consumption and scope-1 data on road traffic.

The method includes CO2-, CH4- and N2O-emission in the inventory.

As for the national inventories the calculation is built into several levels (Tiers) with increased requirements for municipalities regarding data quality. Each municipality may use different tiers for different sectors depending on the data available.

Tier 1 is mainly based on the Danish national greenhouse gas inventory data using appropriate distribution keys, in most cases the municipality's share of total population, for a given activity into municipality level.

Tier 2 is more detailed and includes emission factors used in the Danish national greenhouse gas inventories, while municipalities use their own activity data.

The cognitive foundation for producing the inventory is represented by the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, created by the Emilia-Romagna Region and ARPA Emilia-Romagna, according to the standard methods of estimation recognised on an international level (IPCC, CORINAIR). To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a ""top-down"" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level.
The overall picture of emissions of the Terre Estensi Association was built from the emissions inventory of the individual Municipalities of Ferrara, Masi Torello and Voghiera that constitute the Association, making the sum of the contributions of the three Municipalities. In line with the agreements within the Regional Work Group on Climate Plans, the year 2007 was chosen as a baseline reference year.

Year taken as reference for calculations is 1990, in which the total CO2 emissions in the municipality of Piacenza amounted to 615,452 tons.

Following the guidelines of the EU total emissions have been separated the quantities resulting from industrial / commercial and the relative proportion of mobility on the same highway as Admiral. The Town Council has no direct powers. Therefore, emissions from sectors which Admiral. They can hack through their regulatory instruments / regulations and their initiatives / incentives (Municipality as Consumer, Construction and Urban Planning, Mobility and Transport, Agriculture and Forestry, Waste Management, Strategic Planning, Communication and Information) amounted to 284,462 tons., as the basis on which to calculate the amount to be cut down to move in 2020 to a value of at least 20% lower than in 1990.

In 2020, CO2 emissions from the sectors mentioned above correspond without corrective action to 338,259 tons. The set of actions that will be put in place will generate savings of 111,926 tons to 226,333 tons, bringing this value. equal to the value of 1990 decreased by 20.4%.

Over the same timeframe, the population increased by 5.0 per cent and the GDP increased by 8.4 per cent. Subsequently, the emissions intensity by population decreased from 7.6 to 7.3 tCO2e per capita. Similarly the emissions intensity by GDP decreased from 160 to 149 tCO2e per million $NZ (2009/2010 price).

Scope 1 & 3 emissions from district heating & cooling system and other in-boundary fuel combustion for heating
Scope 2 & 3 emissions of the house-hold electricity consumption within the community boundary
Scope 1 & 3 emissions of use of gas  e.g. cooking

Scope 1 & 3 emissions for the fuel consumption from road traffic, non-road vehicles and shipping, & scope 1 emissions from aviation (within the landing & take-off cycle, i.e. up to 915m).

This means that scope 3 emissions from transport of inhabitants outside the community boundary is not included (but transport of non-inhabitants within the community boundary is). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is a source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.

Meanwhile , the population has grown by about 200 000 inhabitants. In Stockholm, it can be said that the reduction in per capita emissions by half will depend on the actual response , half of the population growth .

The 2013 follow-up of greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is estimated at 3.0 tonnes per capita in 2012. The estimates are preliminary and based on forecasted values. Calculated values for the 2011 greenhouse gas emissions, based on available statistics and modeling, is 3.2 tonnes per capita .
Energy use for heating has decreased in 2012, which is probably due to energy efficiency measures and conversions ( from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. The use of gas in the city decreases. Electricity use is however quite constant. There has been a large reduction in car traffic and a slight increase in the share of light trucks.
In the category of passenger cars have petrol car proportion dropped in favor of gas and ethanol cars, but most of all diesel cars. Diesel passenger cars consist increasingly of environmentally rated efficient diesel cars. Along with the decrease in transport activity ,this leads to strong overall emission reductions in the transport sector.

The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).

Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.

Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services.

This reflects the decrease in overall emissions for the UK during this period driven mainly by reductions in emissions from power stations, industrial combustion and passenger cars. The reduction from power stations is driven by change in the fuel mix used for electricity generation with a reduction in the amount of coal which is a carbon intensive fuel. The reduction in industrial combustion is largely driven by the closure or reduced activity of industrial plants, a large portion of which occurred during 2009 likely due to economic factors.;267.8;1101360.0;2014.0;140.0;9.2;84000000000.0;GBP     Pound Sterling;2014.0;"""Global city GDP 2014"".

City of Baltimore;35853;USA;Baltimore;;2016;12/31/2010 12:00:00 AM;U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI);"ICLEI’s methodology provides a systematic framework for local governments to track energy- and waste-related activities in the community, and to calculate the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by each activity and sector. The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.

Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.";7579144.0;(39.2903848, -76.6121893);(37.09024, -95.712891);2010-12-31;;;;;;;Administrative boundary of a local government;;;CO2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;210.0;622793.0;2014.0;240.0;14.7;43700000000000.0;USD     US Dollar;2014.0;National Association of Counties/U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis;

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.;13.0;27450.0;2014.0;26.0;21.0;23000000.0;USD     US Dollar;2014.0;Solano EDC http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/bos/working_to_create_jobs/economic_studies.asp;

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory.

were calculated based on the destruction of volatile material in
anaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration and
flow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet of
digester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solids
destroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the daily
nitrogen load discharged by each of the City’s 14 wastewater
treatment plant to the formula in the LGOP.

Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gas
collection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani-

applying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken from
EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from natural
gas distribution was calculated using data provided by National

Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas.

However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%.
Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period).
Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs.

This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008.

A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.";3692.0;662400.0;2015.0;15.0;11.0;300827000000.0;USD     US Dollar;2014.0;US Dept Commerce for Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue region;

The software has been updated over time to reflect current scientific understanding and to remain consistent with the latest inventory protocols. Since 2011, the City has used ICLEI’s web-based ClearPath software, which allows for efficient protocol updates, technical support, and improved forecasting and planning strategies. Data pertaining to energy use, fuel consumption, and waste is gathered from City departments, community agencies, and service providers and entered into the software to generate GHG inventories for both municipal operations and for the community as a whole.

Generally we continue on a downward emissions trend, with a 1% reduction from 2011 to 2015. Community emissions per capita have also steadily dropped over time from 17.51 to 12.24 metric tons CO2e/person, a 30 % reduction, from 2002 to 2015. In addition, per capita emissions are 34% lower for Denton than for the U.S. average, in 2015 (World Bank). 

The largest sources of community GHGs are from transportation (46%) and from residential (19%), commercial (10%), and industrial (18%) electricity consumption (together totaling 47% of Community GHGs). Emissions from the wastewater digester represent less than 1 % of total municipal GHG’s.

As with municipal operations, Community electricity related emissions have dropped by 26% from 2006, including a 3% drop from 2011 to 2015. This reduction is largely due to DME purchasing 40% wind electricity for all Denton customers beginning in 2009, and reducing purchases from coal produced electricity by 44% from 2011 to 2015.  It is important to note, that electricity related emissions from municipal operations dropped 11% from 2011 to 2015. In addition DME expanded it’s free residential and small commercial energy audit program in 2008, and launched the GreenSense Energy Efficiency Rebate program for residential and small commercial customers in 2009.  The City created a Conservation Program Coordinator position in 2014 to enhance the audit and rebate program, and to develop increased public education about energy and water conservation. In addition, the City created a Bike and Pedestrian Coordinator position in 2015, to implement the Bike Plan adopted in February 2012.

However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%.
Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period).
Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs.

This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008.

The 2007 inventory found that a total of 5,365,412 tons of CO2e​ were emitted in Greensboro.  The 2013 inventory showed a decrease of 897,721 tons to 4,467,691 tons of CO2e.

Among the factors found to be contributing to this reduction were:  1) greater energy efficiency and conservation in the residential and commercial sectors; 2) reduced number of industrial operations that are highly energy intensive; 3) conversion of Duke Energy's power generation plant fleet away from coal-fired units to natural gas fired units; and 4) reduced total motor vehicle miles traveled in Greensboro.

Additional factors that may have influenced this reduction include:  1) the national economic recession, during which many commercial and industrial sectors experienced significant contractions, many workers were unemployed, and many households downsized to smaller less energy consuming dwellings; and 2) the Better Buildings for Greensboro program, which received $4.7M through American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The program provided:  a) free compact fluorescent lightbulbs, b) low-flow showerheads, c) Kill-A-Watt energy usage meters, d) home energy efficiency audits e) low-interest financing for purchase of energy-efficient appliances, f) energy bill rebates for home energy-efficiency upgrades, and g) funding for energy-efficiency upgrades to business and government buildings.";346.5;287027.0;2017.0;272.0;15.0;;;;;

The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.";7230859.0;(39.2903848, -76.6121893);(37.09024, -95.712891);2014-01-01;North America;;Public;;2014-12-31;364 days;Administrative boundary of a local government;;;"CO2; CH4; N2O";Total Scope 1 and Scope 2;;;;;;;12032078.0;3211447.0;;;;medium/high.

During November 2015, the city reshaped and scoped calendar year 2012 emissions according to the new GPC BASIC framework to Compact of Mayor's requirements.  The GPC expanded the scope of the verified 2012 inventory to report sources such as from natural gas leakage from the distribution system, district electricity, transmission, and distribution electric losses, wastewater, agriculture/farming, ships and boats (non-ferry), off-road equipment and stationary sources.  This resulted in a higher emission number than originally verified by a third party.  The GPC was used for the 2015 community-wide inventory (not-verified) yet assured by C40 that emissions were in fact correct.;4981652.0;(37.7749295, -122.4194155);(37.09024, -95.712891);2015-01-01;North America;;Public;;2015-12-31;364 days;Other: Geopolitical Boundary - physical areas over which local government has jurisdictional control;;;;Total Scope 1, Scope 2 and Waste Scope 3 (Total BASIC emissions);;;;;;;3765407.0;1076061.0;;;;;Other: Methodology Change;"Residential, Commercial/Industrial, Transportation (private, commercial, public/mass transit), Waste as well as Municipal emissions continues to decrease due to the City of San Francisco's progressive climate policies and commitment to implementing effective emission reduction strategies.  

A total reduction of approximately 6% in community-wide emissions was observed compared to the last verified inventory carried out during CY2012.  

The Stationary Energy sector emissions decreased ~11% because natural gas and electricity consumption decreased across all sub-sectors.  

The Transportation sector emissions decreased by ~3% predominately affected by significant decreases in the Waterborne Navigation and On-road Transporation subsectors.  This occurred despite an emissions increase in the Railways sub-sector emissions which was affected by a methodology change in the way Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) began collecting more specific power data and their use of a more conservative or higher emissions factor starting CY2013.

Regarding the Waste sector, first, wastewater fugitive data collection was improved with better activity data.  This resulted in a more accurate picture of the contribution of fugitive wastewater emissions; thus, cutting by nearly half what was originally reporting in 2012. Consequently, when we compare the Waste sector since last inventoried,  emissions actually increased 18% influenced by not only an increase in total wastewater treatment and discharge emissions, but also because of an 18% increase in solid waste disposed emissions.  The updated CY2013 waste characterization study was more detailed which allowed a closer look at organic waste.  As a result, the category ""Other Organic Waste"" is now included as organic; previously categorized as inorganic.  Recategorization alone resulted in a 9% emissions increase.   The remaining 9% was a result of an increase in Wood+Textiles as well as Paper landfilled and thus emissions at ~5% and 4%, respectively.

The Agriculture sector emissions increased nearly three-fold because the data source seems to have reported significant increases in CH4 animal waste while not allocating any biogenic emissions; nonetheless, agriculture still remains a fraction of this urban city's overall activity.";121.0;864816.0;2016.0;142.0;14.1;117467440139.0;USD     US Dollar;2015.0;City Controller's Office;

These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry. GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases. A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration. GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill.

This information is provided to us in various reporting categories such as residential, commercial and industrial. We are now receiving this information at the finest level of granularity that can be provided from the utilities. Propane fuel use for transportation is taken from Statistics Canada as recorded for the Province of Alberta, which is then prorated according to the population of Edmonton compared to the population of Alberta. The diesel and gasoline use in litres is done in a similar fashion, but the information in this case is provided to us from the Alberta provincial government. This information is further adjusted by provincial fleet data and mileage statistics available for vehicle type. The natural gas consumption in vehicles is received directly from the natural gas distributor. The conversion factors are derived from various sources: electricity grid intensity comes from Statistics Canada - this factor, is always two years behind the calendar year; natural gas and liquid fuel combustion factors are from US Environmental protection Agency, and Natural Resources Canada references, and the local utilities.

The GPC 2012 shares the terminology of various international programs reporting of emissions, including the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol (IEAP-ICLEI) and the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Moreover, GPC 2012 converses directly with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.Aiming at a broad identification of emission sources and the establishment of a flow of information necessary for the completion of this study, four teams were created themes, being: stationary units, mobile units, and waste, industrial processes and product uses. The teams were grouped in four thematic workshops held between 26 and 27 June 2012 at the Administrative Center of the city of Goiania. During the implementation of these workshops were identified institutions and those responsible for sending the information necessary for calculations of emissions of greenhouse gases in the municipality.For calculations of GHG emissions used the IPCC Inventory Software (IIS) version 2.0, a software developed and provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).The data were placed on the software as a correspondence between GPC and IPCC categories, except in the case of the activities of electricity consumption (scope 2 emissions, the GPC category that has no corresponding IPCC - these emissions have been included in Section 5 - other).Another category that deserves observation refers to the disposal of solid waste in landfills. For this category we used the GPC, which allocates all expected emissions inventory in the year in which the waste is landfilled, IIS was not used for the calculation of this emission source.;2016320.0;(-16.6868912, -49.2647943);(-14.235004, -51.92528);2017-01-01;Latin America;;Public;;2017-12-31;364 days;Administrative boundary of a local government;;;;Total Scope 1 and Scope 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;739.0;1301892.0;2010.0;749.0;23.2;30131330.0;BRL     Brazilian Real;2010.0;IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistical;

This is associated with a decrease in the burning of fossil fuels in the city boundaries.  The population has increased by 31,140 citizens from 2015 to 2016, which has driven an increase (+2.6%) in solid waste and emissions from wastewater treatment.  There was a 2.3% decrease in stationary energy (SE) use Scope 1 emissions, which may be due to a warmer than average winter, and 2.2% decrease in SE Scope 2 emissions relating to electricity, which may be due to more efficient use of electricity and more renewable energy on the Provincial grid.  The sector which saw the greatest decrease (-4.9%) in emissions was from Transportation.  This is likely a result of the economic downturn that Calgary has experienced since 2014.  A high unemployment rate means that less workers are commuting, and perhaps trips for leisure have also been curtailed.;848.0;1235055.0;2016.0;1084.0;4.1;113400000000.0;CAD     Canadian Dollar;2016.0;http://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/dmsdocument/22;

The City does a full energy profile update every 5 years. The process includes a baseline data collection which was collected from the following 5 sectors: Residential Sector, Commercial Sector, Sector, Local Government, Transport Sector. For the 2017 CDP submission, the City undertook a process to update its GPC data by updating the two major energy sources with actual available data, i.e. Electricity and liquid fuel sections. For the remaining energy sources (coal and solid waste), a scaling factor was used calculate the 2015 data. Therefore all the data reported for the 2017 CDP is based on 2015 base year. The City's GHG account/inventory is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors.  In the 2017 Cape Town GPC summary table provided (base year 2015), Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town.

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.;13.0;27450.0;2014.0;26.0;21.0;23000000.0;USD     US Dollar;2014.0;Solano EDC http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/bos/working_to_create_jobs/economic_studies.asp;

Other items to note on year-over-year change include the following: Scope 1 emissions have decreased by about -20% compared to 2005.

Regional transportation models are used to calculate vehicle-miles-traveled in Boston, which are then split into diesel and gasoline based on the State diesel and gas consumption split. Then each fuel type is divided into the average fleet mix categories (ICLEI 2009) and the EPA emissions factor for each vehicle type are applied to calculate the GHG. A 10% ethanol content for gasoline is also accounted for.

While emissions from transit have increased as the municipal and regional population has increased dramatically, other sectors have decreased significantly. 

Residential energy use has decreased by 15,000 metric tons of co2e in large part due to shifts in energy sourcing from PG&E. 

Countywide efforts to decrease land-filled waste have helped cut co2e from waste more than in half (from about 47,000 tons CO2e to only 20,105) with further reductions planned for the future. 

Commercial energy, which also shows a drop, is anomalous.  While the shift in PG&E sourcing has undoubtedly reduced the amount of GHG emissions, the so-called 15/15 Rule prohibits us from seeing exact industrial natural gas emissions.

This decline is due to decarbonisation of the national electricity grid, with a reduction in coal use and an increase in renewables share of the national energy mix. Gas usage has also decreased, due to energy efficiency improvements in homes and workplaces (including the roll-out of more efficient gas fired boilers) and a reduction in industrial activity within London.

Recalculating 2003 and 2008 inventories to compare to the 2013 inventory shows that emissions have decreased by about 4% since the 2008 inventory, but have still increased by 10% since 2003. Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region. Natural gas emissions increased almost three-fold since 2003.;151.0;305704.0;2016.0;293.0;11.1;135662.0;USD     US Dollar;2014.0;http://www.pittsburghtoday.org/view_GDP2.html;

This represents a change from our GHG emissions tonnage figure reported to CDP in 2015 and a slight decrease in the first 2013 Global GHC protocol compliant Baseline Emissions inventory.  Repeating the reasons for the change - between emissions reported in 2015 submission and now (due to move to a compliant BEI process), this is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport;1277.0;2762000.0;2014.0;250.0;9.5;58000000000.0;GBP     Pound Sterling;2015.0;this is GVA (NOT GDP which is GVA+taxes-subsidies but this isn't available to us).  this is the Oxford Economics figure which has been deflated to 2013 prices and is the most used figure in policy documents.;

However, due to limitations associated with the data, year to year comparisons must be made with caution.   

In general, emissions over the past few years appear to be staying the same or potentially decreasing slightly despite population increases.

As in 2013, the scope 1 emissions are dominated by transport emissions, which have remained fairly constant across the period, demonstrating a 5kt increase. This change is largely due to increases in estimates in private marine fuel consumption after the use of more detailed, disaggregated fuel import data, as described in Section 4.2.1 of the inventory report. IPPU emissions remain a significant source of scope 1 emissions, and have also increased by 1kt in comparison to 2013. Emissions in this sector are estimated using population as a proxy, and therefore population growth within Gibraltar will have somewhat influenced the calculated increase in scope 1 emissions. Improved data has also been used to calculate IPPU emissions in Gibraltar; for example, activity data regarding MDIs and N2O use has been provided by the Gibraltar Health Authority, rather than relying on scaling UK data. 
When scope 2 emissions are considered, there is a 30kt decline in total emissions. A reduction in consumed gas oil used for electricity generation and an apparent improvement of the implied emission factor cause a decline in emissions from residential, and commercial, industrial, and government buildings and facilities. This is largely responsible for this trend.
Waterborne navigation emissions have declined due to a methodology change within the calculation of emissions from shipping. As outlined in Section 4.2.3 of the inventory report, the definition of shipping attributable to Gibraltar on the basis of the recorded ‘purpose of call’ has undergone significant changes, and as a result, the emissions from scope 3 are largely reduced in 2015. 
Because of a large number of method changes, an updated reporting approach using the now-finalised GPC, and data for the 2015 inventory method not being available for updating the 2013 inventory, it is not possible to confidently identify how much change in emissions is due to changing method versus changing activity. Future years will seek to ensure that the time series is revised where possible to allow such comparisons to be made.";6.6;33528.0;2015.0;;18.0;1637750000.0;GIP     Gibraltar pound;2015.0;https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/new/sites/default/files/HMGoG_Documents/Abstract%202014.pdf;

Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City.

Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015.

The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.";606.0;2720546.0;2015.0;181.0;9.4;563188000000.0;;2014.0;Brookings Institution;

The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services.All calculations in regards to primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions are made with the balancing program ECORegion (http://www.ecospeed.ch/).;1822367.0;(47.3686498, 8.5391825);(46.818188, 8.227512);2014-01-01;Europe;;Public;;2014-12-31;364 days;Administrative boundary of a local government;;;"CO2; PFCs; CH4; SF6; N2O; NF3; HFCs";Total Scope 1 and Scope 2;;;;;;;;;;;;2000-Watt society Methodology;Other: No change;The course of greenhouse gas emissions since 2008 is more or less constant.

L’étude porte sur le territoire de la Commune de Cocody voir  CARTE. Toutefois, du fait de l’interaction de ce territoire avec les autres communes du District d’Abidjan ainsi qu’avec le reste de la Côte d’Ivoire (flux vers Yamoussoukro, Bouaké et vers Korhogo…), l’étude devra porter, quand de nécessaire, sur l’ensemble de la Côte d’Ivoire.Avec  l’approche  inventaire  territorial  retenue,  les  émissions  prises  en  compte  sont  les émissions directes (Scope 1) et les émissions indirectes associées à l’énergie (Scope2) pour tous les secteurs étudiés.Dans le diagnostic, six secteurs ont été définis et analysés : (i) le secteur résidentiel ; (ii) le secteur industriel (usines et unités de transformation) ; (iii) le secteur tertiaire ; (iv) le secteur transport ; (v) le secteur déchets ; et (vi) le secteur agriculture et forêt.Les différents postes d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre ont pu être identifiés et classés en fonction de leur importance.

The Town Council has no direct powers. Therefore, emissions from sectors which Admiral. They can hack through their regulatory instruments / regulations and their initiatives / incentives (Municipality as Consumer, Construction and Urban Planning, Mobility and Transport, Agriculture and Forestry, Waste Management, Strategic Planning, Communication and Information) amounted to 284,462 tons., as the basis on which to calculate the amount to be cut down to move in 2020 to a value of at least 20% lower than in 1990.In 2020, CO2 emissions from the sectors mentioned above correspond without corrective action to 338,259 tons. The set of actions that will be put in place will generate savings of 111,926 tons to 226,333 tons, bringing this value. equal to the value of 1990 decreased by 20.4%.

The GPC 2012 shares the terminology of various international programs reporting of emissions, including the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol (IEAP-ICLEI) and the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Moreover, GPC 2012 converses directly with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.Aiming at a broad identification of emission sources and the establishment of a flow of information necessary for the completion of this study, four teams were created themes, being: stationary units, mobile units, and waste, industrial processes and product uses. The teams were grouped in four thematic workshops held between 26 and 27 June 2012 at the Administrative Center of the city of Goiania. During the implementation of these workshops were identified institutions and those responsible for sending the information necessary for calculations of emissions of greenhouse gases in the municipality.For calculations of GHG emissions used the IPCC Inventory Software (IIS) version 2.0, a software developed and provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).The data were placed on the software as a correspondence between GPC and IPCC categories, except in the case of the activities of electricity consumption (scope 2 emissions, the GPC category that has no corresponding IPCC - these emissions have been included in Section 5 - other).Another category that deserves observation refers to the disposal of solid waste in landfills. For this category we used the GPC, which allocates all expected emissions inventory in the year in which the waste is landfilled, IIS was not used for the calculation of this emission source.;;POINT (-49.2648 -16.6869);;2016-07-04;Latin America;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;In progress;2017-07-03;364 days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1495705000.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Stadt Zürich;35449;Switzerland;Zürich;;2019;2018-01-01 - 2018-12-31;Other: 2000-Watt-Methodology;The 2000-Watt society methodology is a concept of sustainable development that uses two indicators: Primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).  Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.  Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services.;;POINT (8.53918 47.3686);;2018-01-01;Europe;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, NF3, PFCs, SF6;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Decreased;Technological change;;428737.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Malang City;73762;Indonesia;;;2019;2018-06-01 - 2019-06-03;2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories;Inventarisasi emisi gas rumah kaca (GRK) Kota Malang meliputi perhitungan emisi dan serapan untuk tahun 2018. Adapun sektor-sektor penyumbang dan penyerap emisi di Kota Malang meliputi sektor energi, sektor pertanian dan kehutanan (AFOLU)3, dan sektor limbah. Sektor proses industri dan penggunaan produk tidak termasuk dalam ruang lingkup inventarisasi karena karena data terkait sektor ini seperti penggunaan pelumas di sub sektor transportasi dan industri belum dapat diidentifikasi di Kota Malang. Jenis gas yang dilaporkan dari sektor-sektor penyumbang/penyerap emisi terdiri dari gas karbondioksida (CO2), gas metana (CH4) dan gas dinitro oksida (N2O).Hasil inventarisasi ini selanjutnya digunakan sebagai acuan bagi perencanaan terpadu dalam upaya menurunkan emisi GRK. Upaya penurunan GRK sebagaimana komitmen nasional dilakukan dengan mempertimbangkan skenario kenaikan emisi di masa yang akan datang.Berdasarkan total kontribusi kumulatifnya, maka sekitar 42% sumber emisi dikontribusikan oleh sektor penggunaan listrik pemukiman (sektor energi lainnya). Sektor Transportasi mengambil 31% total kontribusi. Kemudian limbah padat sebesar 13%.  Berdasarkan kontribusi kumulatif tersebut, maka perlu prioritas yang dilakukan pada aksi mitigasi dan penyusunan rencana aksi daerah (RAD) gas rumah kaca (GRK).;;;;2018-06-01;Southeast Asia and Oceania;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2019-06-03;367 days;;Larger – covers the whole city and adjoining areas;;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Increased;Increased energy/electricity consumption;;861414.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Essas concentrações foram consideradas nos cálculos e aplicadas ao total de cada combustível verificado para o município, de acordo com os desenvolvimentos regulatórios do setor. Emissões de GEE para o consumo de eletricidade - As emissões indiretas de CO2 por consumo de eletricidade foram calculadas levando-se em consideração o fator de emissão médio do Sistema Interligado Nacional em cada ano do período considerado. Emissões de GEE por tratamento e lançamento de efluentes líquidos - Belo Horizonte possui 4 ETARs em operação, que emitem metano e óxido nitroso.Há uma quinta ETE que emprega processos físico-químicos que não emitem gases de efeito estufa. Uma fração do esgoto coletado em Belo Horizonte não é encaminhada para nenhuma estação de tratamento, sendo depositada diretamente no corpo d'água; outra fração de esgoto, que não é coletada, é presumivelmente tratada em sistemas sépticos (fossas sépticas), seguida de infiltração. Emissões de GEE por tratamento de resíduos sólidos urbanos - Aterro - Os resíduos sólidos gerados em Belo Horizonte são levados para disposição em aterro sanitário (CTR Macaúbas), onde não há sistema de recuperação de biogás. Assumiu-se que 100% do biogás gerado em resíduos sólidos urbanos em massa é liberado na atmosfera. Uma fração do lixo coletado na cidade ainda está disposta ao centro de tratamento maciço CTR-BR-040, em Belo Horizonte, em uma área separada onde, a partir de 2010, iniciou um sistema de geração termelétrica a partir do biogás gerado no aterro. Assim, o biogás derivado do antigo resíduo maciço não deve ser considerado no inventário de GEE a partir de 2010. É considerado apenas a fração derivada das provisões em área separada recente e não coberta pelo sistema de recuperação de biogás. Vale ressaltar que, de acordo com este modelo de decaimento de primeira ordem, para fins deste inventário, adotamos um período de 10 (dez) anos como degradação do horizonte de resíduos dentro do maciço. Compostagem - A BH também realiza compostagem para resíduos orgânicos.

Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is a source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001 and Thermal Engineering Research Institute (Värmeforsk) in 2011. The reports are widely used and acknowledged. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2013, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).Energy statistics are collected from different sources: district heating & gas statistics are collected from the companies; electricity statistics is compiled and collected from Statistics Sweden; emissions from road transport is modeled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm (includes a variety vehicles, speeds, road types etc) and non-road emissions are taken from Statistics Sweden; marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions & energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Ports of Stockholm.";;POINT (18.0686 59.3293);;2017-01-01;Europe;C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2017-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;No;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;1776007.0;762200.0;36794.0;1715597.0;1752391.0;;Decreased;Technological change;;949761.0;2017.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Electricity and gas data was provided by utility operators by postcode and market segment (domestic, commercial, industrial). While best available, variations and discrepancies in the data are common from year to year. Emissions from private vehicle use were estimated using a transport model built by Council using reliable traffic count data from State government agencies, apportioned across vehicle class and fuel type based on survey data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Emissions from trams and trains estimated based on vehicle kilometers traveled (timetable frequency x track length) and energy and CO2e per km figures provided by transport operators. Emissions from waterbourne transport estimated based on actual shipping movement data, annual tonnages, and time in port. The amount of waste produced within the municipality was estimated from a waste study undertaken in 2017, which includes MSW volume data provided directly by waste contractors.;;POINT (144.963 -37.8141);;2018-01-01;Southeast Asia and Oceania;C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;Yes;CH4, CO2, N20;;;993193.74;;3396147.81;;603188.08;;;;;;;Increased;;;169961.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Es importante recalcar que como menciona el GPC, la cuantificación y el reporte justo y real de emisiones de GEI  de una ciudad o municipio están basados en cinco principios fundamentales que incluyen: la relevancia, la exhaustividad, la coherencia, la transparencia y la precisión. Por otra parte  para el inventario con el que se cuenta 2012-2015 (recopilación de datos en 2012, se elaboró en 2013,  y finalmente se publicó en 2015) se aplicó la metodología del IPCC 2006 y Factores de Emisión (FE), en los que se presentan adecuaciones puntuales en respuesta a las características específicas de las actividades productivas en León; por mencionar algunas consideraciones, además se incluyó la producción artesanal de tabique, con apego a las disposiciones estipuladas en el Programa Especial de Cambio Climático (PECC). El cálculo de GEI y el inventario aquí presentado, son el primer paso para el emprendimiento de una serie de estrategias que atiendan la problemática del cambio climático en el municipio, con base en el registro de la cantidad total de GEI, su distribución en cada sector y las tendencias de generación de estos contaminantes por parte de los distintos sectores.  Asimismo, se añade la estimación de Carbono Negro (CN) para la realización del inventario municipal, por lo que fue necesario recurrir a diferentes fuentes de información oficial, con la finalidad de tener una base sólida y verídica de los datos a emplear para los cálculos de este capítulo. Igualmente se analizó información presentada en diferentes diagnósticos y estudios de áreas específicas dentro del municipio de León, como lo fueron los estudios realizados por el IMPLAN (Instituto Municipal de Planeación) en las zonas del Valladito y el Refugio por loa producción de ladrillos que se realiza en ambas zonas.";;POINT (-101.684 21.1221);;2017-06-01;Latin America;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2018-06-01;365 days;;Larger – covers the whole city and adjoining areas;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, NF3, PFCs, SF6;;0.0;2726988.0;2285593.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;;;;;;;Decreased;Technological change;;1578626.0;2015.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

This information is provided to us in various reporting categories such as residential, commercial and industrial. We are now receiving this information at the finest level of granularity that can be provided from the utilities. Propane fuel use for transportation is taken from Statistics Canada as recorded for the Province of Alberta, which is then prorated according to the population of Edmonton compared to the population of Alberta. The diesel and gasoline use in litres is done in a similar fashion, but the information in this case is provided to us from the Alberta provincial government. This information is further adjusted by provincial registration data. The natural gas consumption in vehicles is received directly from the natural gas distributor.

City of Denizli;840521;Turkey;;;2019;2016-01-01 - 2016-12-31;Global Protocol for Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC);"The Denizli Greenhouse Gas Inventory has been prepared in accordance with Global Protocol for Local GHG Emissions (GPC) which was prepared in 2014 by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) and which is widely used by local governments.The GPC was prepared on the basis of the IPCC National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2006 and updated periodically. In this way, the results described in the following chapters are intended to be comparable and acceptable on a global scale.The inventory prepared at the urban scale includes all the emission sources within the realm of authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality. The authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality covers the provincial boundaries of the province .The inventory content is based on the classification of emission sources set by GPC. When preparing inventory in the framework of GPC, the scope of the inventory was determined depending on the detail, accuracy and reliability of the available data. GPC evaluates greenhouse gas emissions in 3 scopes; Scope 1 - Direct Emissions, Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions and Scope 3 - Indirect (Consumption Based) Emissions. During the preparation of the inventory, all emission sources within the realm of authority of the municipality were scanned and the maximum amount of data was tried to be reached. The emissions under Scope 3 were not included in the inventory due to the fact that it is ver y difficult to reach related data . According to the results of the GPC approach, the total greenhouse gas emissions of Denizli province for the year 2016 were estimated to be 7.5 million tons of CO2e. This amount refers to 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita, which is proportional to the population of Denizli in the same year (1.005.687) and this number is higher than Turkey’s 2016 average calculated as 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita. Total emissions of Denizli in Turkey’s total emissions in 2016 constitute 1.5%.";;;;2016-01-01;Europe;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2016-12-31;365 days;;Larger – covers the whole city and adjoining areas;No;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6;;;;;;;;5851890.0;1650777.0;0.0;5094537.0;7502667.0;;;;;1027782.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories developed by the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Working Group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was taken as a basis on The preparation of the city-scale greenhouse gas emissions inventory.The emission sources which should be included in greenhouse gas emitions and the methodologies used to quantify these sources, differ between institutions, organizations and sectors, but not among local governments. The International Local Government Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis Protocol (IEAP), established by the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), has been drafted within the framework of the general principles and philosophy that apply to each local government, regardless of location. ICLEI was founded in 1990 and has been operating since 2003 under the name of Local Governments for Sustainability. IEAP;Was Compiled on the basis of - IPCC 2006 methodologies,- WRI / WBCSD GHG Protocol,- ISO 14064 GHG Standard series and- Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Annex for Public Sector Institutions.When preparing the emition draft under the IPCC, it is necessary to choose between approaches called TIER 1-2-3 (Level 3 1-2-3), depending on the degree of detail, refraction, accuracy and reliability of the types of data available.

CH4 emissionswere calculated based on the destruction of volatile material inanaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration andflow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet ofdigester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solidsdestroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the dailynitrogen load discharged by each of the City’s 14 wastewatertreatment plant to the formula in the LGOP.Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gascollection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani-tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exportedsolid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi-dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste andapplying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken fromEPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM).

The 2016 emissions inventory provided here was developed as the baseline inventory for HRM's HalifACT 2050 Climate Action Plan, which represents the municipality's long-term mitigation and adaptation strategy. HRM has retained the technical expertise of a skilled team of external consultants (Sustainability Solutions Group) to develop this inventory using a sophisticated energy & emissions modelling tool called CityInSight. This tool builds a long-term energy & emissions profile for the municipality using population and employment data and projections, detailed energy consumption information based on building archetypes and zoning, induced traffic demand projections and detailed information on energy use/production, waste and wastewater production based on all building stock in the municipality.;;POINT (-63.5714 44.6478);;2016-01-01;North America;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2016-12-31;365 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;No;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;2357934.0;3120820.0;305742.0;5351364.0;5648315.0;;Decreased;Improved data accuracy;;441400.0;2016.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

City of Oslo;14088;Norway;Oslo;;2018;2016-01-01 -;2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories;The Norwegian environment agency and Statistics Norway collaborates on developing new and improved GHG-statistics/inventories for Norwegian municipalities. The project utilize 2006 IPCC guidelines for national GHG inventories. The project is ongoing, and has the intention to enable municipalities to report according to the GPC-protocol for scope 1 emissions. As of 2018, the statistics cover the years 2009-2016, and CO2, N2O and CH4. The statistics does not provide municipalities with information about activity data, but for some sources the emission factor is given. Towards 2019, The Norwegian environment agency and Statistics Norway work to further improve the data. A more detailed model for calculating emissions for road traffic is developed, and municipalities will receive data on the LULUCF-sector  (land use, land use change and forestry) excluding HWP (harvested wood products) for the years 2010 and 2015. The statistics for the whole time-series will be recalculated when these projects are finalized winter 2018/2019. Level of confidence for scope 1 emissions will then shift from medium to high. Please note that the use of electricity in Norway is calculated with zero emissions, due to the use of renewable energy (hydropower).;;POINT (10.7522 59.9139);;2016-01-01;Europe;C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;;;;Administrative boundary of a local government;;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;1125349.0;;;;;;Decreased;Policy change;;673469.0;2017.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:54.890

Then each fuel type is divided into the average fleet mix categories (ICLEI 2009) and the EPA emissions factor for each vehicle type are applied to calculate the GHG. Fuel oil consumption is estimated based on sampling, U.S. Census data, and some state consumption figures.;;POINT (-71.0598 42.3584);;2017-01-01;North America;C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2017-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;No;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;4059459.0;2262934.0;;6146099.0;6146099.0;;Decreased;Other;;683015.0;2017.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Dong Hoi City;839931;Viet Nam;;;2019;2018-01-01 - 2018-12-31;Other: Bilan Carbone;Developed by the French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME), the Bilan Carbone tool serves as an accounting method for calculating in details the direct and indirect GHG emissions. Its analysis covers all of six GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs and PFCs) mentioned in Kyoto protocol, CFCs and water vapor released into the stratosphere by airplanes. The Bilan Carbone accordingly provides an overview on the various emission sources and their contributions to climate change. By employing this method, the GHG emissions from different types of reduction scenarios can be estimated, and thereby helps to identify appropriate and effective action plans and/or policies as well as potential implementation options to reduce GHG emissions.The Bilan Carbone method is somewhat similar to the techniques of “Rapid asessment of sources of air, water and land pollution” which are primarily based on the magnitude of emission sources and emission factors. The cores of Bilan Carbone tool are workbooks and spreadsheets in MS. Excel with ready-made calculating and converting formulas. All emission factors are arranged in a separate spreadsheet and linked to corresponding cells in other ones. Thus, in the event the users add or modify emission factors, the results in associated cells and spreadsheets are altered accordingly.;;;;2018-01-01;Southeast Asia and Oceania;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6;;;424089.0;;;;;;;;;;;This is our first year of calculation;;;130950.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Emissions for Sweden have been distributed across the country in a grid where the squares correspond to 1 km2. The distribution is done using relevant statistics and geographical data, such as road networks, pastures, felled forests, population data. This geographical distribution means that the national total emissions are broken down and distributed at regional and local level. The breakdown into higher spatial resolution includes a geographical limitation of where emissions occur (eg road networks) and statistics at regional and local level. This means that the finer the division, the greater the uncertainty.;;;;2017-01-01;Europe;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2017-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6;;12582.4;124766.91;;;;;;;;;;;Decreased;Technological change;;28912.0;2019.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Vinh City;839954;Viet Nam;;;2019;2018-01-01 - 2018-12-31;Other: Bilan Carbone;Developed by the French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME), the Bilan Carbone tool serves as an accounting method for calculating in details the direct and indirect GHG emissions. Its analysis covers all of six GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs and PFCs) mentioned in Kyoto protocol, CFCs and water vapor released into the stratosphere by airplanes. The Bilan Carbone accordingly provides an overview on the various emission sources and their contributions to climate change. By employing this method, the GHG emissions from different types of reduction scenarios can be estimated, and thereby helps to identify appropriate and effective action plans and/or policies as well as potential implementation options to reduce GHG emissions.The Bilan Carbone method is somewhat similar to the techniques of “Rapid asessment of sources of air, water and land pollution” which are primarily based on the magnitude of emission sources and emission factors. The cores of Bilan Carbne tool are workbooks and spreadsheets in MS. Excel with ready-made calculating and converting formulas. All emission factors are arranged in a separate spreadsheet and linked to corresponding cells in other ones. Thus, in the event the users add or modify emission factors, the results in associated cells and spreadsheets are altered accordingly.;;;;2018-01-01;Southeast Asia and Oceania;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6;;;1103438.0;;;;;;;;;;;This is our first year of calculation;;;323800.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Melaka Historic City Council;54367;Malaysia;;;2019;2014-01-01 - 2014-12-30;Global Protocol for Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC);"The GHG inventory covers the area of Majlis Bandaraya Melaka Bersejarah (MBMB) municipality and only emission sources within MBMB are included in the calculation. It is designated that the 2010 is the base year for emission, however, due to lack of information from past years, some indicators has not been included in this report.  At the community level, the main sources of emissions are the burning of fossil fuels for carbon dioxide emissions, automotive exhaust for nitrous oxide emissions and landfills for methane emissions.   The calculation includes three main sources of GHG emissions: 1) Direct emissions from the burning of fossil fuels 2) Indirect emissions from the production of electricity from electricity generation plants 3) The decomposition of biomass to greenhouse gases in landfills The results are presented into sub-sectors; residential, commercial, industry and agriculture for fuel combustion and electricity usage. The standard unit of “equivalent CO2” is used to report the emissions. All sources have one or more associated emission factors for quantify the energy burned in the all three main sectors - buildings, electricity, on-road transportation, solid waste.  A Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) is a quantification of the amount of CO2 emitted due to energy consumption and waste disposal in the territory of a Local Authority within a given period of time. The BEI allows identifying the main CO2 sources on the municipality’s territory, thus helping to select the appropriate actions to curb emissions. The Baseline year is the reference year for setting the objective!  MBMB decided year 2010 as baseline year and calculated the emission for emission sources in Melaka City. The total emission was 1.74 mil tCO2 equivalents.  The highest emitter was transportation sector which is 0.68 mil tCO2, followed by waste sector 0.57 mil tCO2, residential and commercial were 0.26 and 0.22 mil tCO2 respectively.";;;;2014-01-01;Southeast Asia and Oceania;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2014-12-30;363 days;;Partial – covers part of the city and adjoining areas;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This is our first year of calculation;Lack of resource / funding overcome;;524353.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

City of Santa Rosa;60007;Philippines;Santa Rosa;;2019;2010-01-01 - 2010-12-31;2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories;The inventory was completed primarily in accordance with the guidance from the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the current international standard for corporate greenhouse gas inventories , the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG inventories, and Tracking Greenhouse Gases: An Inventory Manual published by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Due to current limitations in data availability, the methodology is modeled after the  ‘tier 1’ approach, which provides guidance on how to estimate GHG emissions using relatively aggregated input  data on fuel usage, combined with default emission factors by fuel.  The City does not have a power plant within its geographical boundaries and its electricity is solely sourced from the Manila Electric Company (MERALCO). Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity consumption are classified as indirect or Scope 2 emissions, if the power plants producing the electricity are physically located outside the geographic boundaries of an LGU. For transportation related emissions the methodology is modeled after IPCC’s ‘tier 1’ approach due to current limitations in data availability.  GHG emissions are therefore estimated using relatively aggregated input data on fuel use, combined with default emission factors by fuel.  Only road transportation emissions are included in the GHG inventory since there are no airports or harbors in the geographical boundary of the City of Santa Rosa. For solid wastes, it is based on the First Order Decay method.  Such method recognizes the process by which CH4 and CO2 are formed in solid waste disposal sites, which is through slow decay throughout a few decades of degradable organic components in waste. For the doemstic wastewater, CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated.;;POINT (121.089 14.2843);;2010-01-01;Southeast Asia and Oceania;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2010-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Increased;Population increase;;353800.0;2015.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Essas concentrações foram consideradas nos cálculos e aplicadas ao total de cada combustível verificado para o município, de acordo com os desenvolvimentos regulatórios do setor. Emissões de GEE para o consumo de eletricidade - As emissões indiretas de CO2 por consumo de eletricidade foram calculadas levando-se em consideração o fator de emissão médio do Sistema Interligado Nacional em cada ano do período considerado. Emissões de GEE por tratamento e lançamento de efluentes líquidos - Belo Horizonte possui 4 ETARs em operação, que emitem metano e óxido nitroso.Há uma quinta ETE que emprega processos físico-químicos que não emitem gases de efeito estufa. Uma fração do esgoto coletado em Belo Horizonte não é encaminhada para nenhuma estação de tratamento, sendo depositada diretamente no corpo d'água; outra fração de esgoto, que não é coletada, é presumivelmente tratada em sistemas sépticos (fossas sépticas), seguida de infiltração. Emissões de GEE por tratamento de resíduos sólidos urbanos - Aterro - Os resíduos sólidos gerados em Belo Horizonte são levados para disposição em aterro sanitário (CTR Macaúbas), onde não há sistema de recuperação de biogás. Assumiu-se que 100% do biogás gerado em resíduos sólidos urbanos em massa é liberado na atmosfera. Uma fração do lixo coletado na cidade ainda está disposta ao centro de tratamento maciço CTR-BR-040, em Belo Horizonte, em uma área separada onde, a partir de 2010, iniciou um sistema de geração termelétrica a partir do biogás gerado no aterro. Assim, o biogás derivado do antigo resíduo maciço não deve ser considerado no inventário de GEE a partir de 2010. É considerado apenas a fração derivada das provisões em área separada recente e não coberta pelo sistema de recuperação de biogás. Vale ressaltar que, de acordo com este modelo de decaimento de primeira ordem, para fins deste inventário, adotamos um período de 10 (dez) anos como degradação do horizonte de resíduos dentro do maciço. Compostagem - A BH também realiza compostagem para resíduos orgânicos. Essas atividades ocorrem no CTRS Rod BR-040 e podem incorrer em óxido nitroso e metano.";;POINT (-43.9345 -19.9167);;2016-01-01;Latin America;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2016-12-31;365 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;No;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;2484635.6;466725.77;1441939.49;4393300.86;;;Decreased;Change in accounting methodology;;2513451.0;2016.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is a source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001 and Thermal Engineering Research Institute (Värmeforsk) in 2011. The reports are widely used and acknowledged. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2013, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).Energy statistics are collected from different sources: district heating & gas statistics are collected from the companies; electricity statistics is compiled and collected from Statistics Sweden; emissions from road transport is modeled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm (includes a variety vehicles, speeds, road types etc) and non-road emissions are taken from Statistics Sweden; marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions & energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Ports of Stockholm.";;POINT (18.0686 59.3293);;2017-01-01;Europe;C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2017-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;No;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;1776007.0;762200.0;36794.0;1715597.0;1752391.0;;Decreased;Technological change;;949761.0;2017.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

City of Edmonton;43912;Canada;Edmonton;;2019;2018-01-01 - 2018-12-31;Global Protocol for Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC);Completing the inventory involves acquiring the total natural gas and electricity used by all residents, industry, institutions, and commercial properties within the city's boundaries from the primary natural gas and electricity providers. This information is provided to us in various reporting categories such as residential, commercial and industrial. We are now receiving this information at the finest level of granularity that can be provided from the utilities. Propane fuel use for transportation is taken from Statistics Canada as recorded for the Province of Alberta, which is then prorated according to the population of Edmonton compared to the population of Alberta. The diesel and gasoline use in litres is done in a similar fashion, but the information in this case is provided to us from the Alberta provincial government. This information is further adjusted by provincial registration data. The natural gas consumption in vehicles is received directly from the natural gas distributor. The emission factors are taken from the 2018 National Inventory Report. The data are input manually each year into an excel spreadsheet model.;;POINT (-113.491 53.5444);;2018-01-01;North America;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;No;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;10981088.0;5807488.0;2573906.0;15936756.0;19167399.0;;Increased;Increased energy/electricity consumption;;980000.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217
City of Denizli;840521;Turkey;;;2019;2016-01-01 - 2016-12-31;Global Protocol for Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC);"The Denizli Greenhouse Gas Inventory has been prepared in accordance with Global Protocol for Local GHG Emissions (GPC) which was prepared in 2014 by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) and which is widely used by local governments.The GPC was prepared on the basis of the IPCC National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2006 and updated periodically. In this way, the results described in the following chapters are intended to be comparable and acceptable on a global scale.The inventory prepared at the urban scale includes all the emission sources within the realm of authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality. The authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality covers the provincial boundaries of the province .The inventory content is based on the classification of emission sources set by GPC. When preparing inventory in the framework of GPC, the scope of the inventory was determined depending on the detail, accuracy and reliability of the available data. GPC evaluates greenhouse gas emissions in 3 scopes; Scope 1 - Direct Emissions, Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions and Scope 3 - Indirect (Consumption Based) Emissions. During the preparation of the inventory, all emission sources within the realm of authority of the municipality were scanned and the maximum amount of data was tried to be reached. The emissions under Scope 3 were not included in the inventory due to the fact that it is ver y difficult to reach related data . According to the results of the GPC approach, the total greenhouse gas emissions of Denizli province for the year 2016 were estimated to be 7.5 million tons of CO2e. This amount refers to 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita, which is proportional to the population of Denizli in the same year (1.005.687) and this number is higher than Turkey’s 2016 average calculated as 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita. Total emissions of Denizli in Turkey’s total emissions in 2016 constitute 1.5%.";;;;2016-01-01;Europe;CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, WWF;public;Yes;2016-12-31;365 days;;Larger – covers the whole city and adjoining areas;No;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6;;;;;;;;5851890.0;1650777.0;0.0;5094537.0;7502667.0;;;;;1027782.0;2018.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

Actual measurements are available for electricity, natural gas, and steam (obtained directly from energy utilities), and all sources related to mass transit, the airport, and water and sewer (obtained from the regional authorities). Regional transportation models are used to calculate vehicle-miles-traveled in Boston, which are then split into diesel and gasoline based on the State diesel and gas consumption split. Then each fuel type is divided into the average fleet mix categories (ICLEI 2009) and the EPA emissions factor for each vehicle type are applied to calculate the GHG. Fuel oil consumption is estimated based on sampling, U.S. Census data, and some state consumption figures.;;POINT (-71.0598 42.3584);;2017-01-01;North America;C40, CDP Cities, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability;public;Yes;2017-12-31;364 days;;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;No;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;4059459.0;2262934.0;;6146099.0;6146099.0;;Decreased;Other;;683015.0;2017.0;;;;;;;2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

City of Turku;50154;Finland;Turku;;2020;2018-01-01 - 2018-12-31;2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories;Turku carries out GHG inventories covering all existing CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from energy, transportation, agriculture and waste. Parallel calculations have been carried out using different methodologies including EU Covenant of Mayors (CoM) methodology and CO2-report as described in detail in Turku’s Climate Plan 2029 (SECAP). For best consistency with the CRF requirements, the data provided here is based on the ALas model (Alueellinen Laskenta, regional calculation) provided by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). In broad terms, the calculation is similar to the basic level of GPC standard, with agriculture, F-gases and grid losses included, but without the local air service included in the standard. However, for consistency with baseline data F-gases are excluded from the report below and local air service emissions are included according to the CO2-report.In 2019 Turku reported GHG emissions using the CoM methodology, following the recommendation of CDP representatives. In previous years, another methodology (CO2-report) has been used. The emissions have been estimated for 1990 and 2015 using the CoM methodology, whereas emissions following CO2-report methodology are available for a more comprehensive time-series (1990, 2000, 2008 - 2018). For the time being, ALas model covers the years from 2005 onward.Despite the minor differences in the methodologies and differencies in the update cycle and data coverage, all the models show very similar declining progress towards the carbon neutrality target in the future. We are committed to improve the data and methodologies in collaboration with expert organisations in Finland and beyond.;;POINT (22.2666 60.4518);;2018-01-01;Europe;;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;City / Municipality;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, N20;;;411300.0;;483300.0;;;;;;;;;Decreased;Technological change;246.0;193000.0;2019.0;;;;;;;2021-04-10T02:18:55.717

Emissões de GEE para o consumo de eletricidade - As emissões indiretas de CO2 por consumo de eletricidade foram calculadas levando-se em consideração o fator de emissão médio do Sistema Interligado Nacional em cada ano do período considerado. Emissões de GEE por tratamento e lançamento de efluentes líquidos - Belo Horizonte possui 4 ETEs em operação, que emitem metano e óxido nitroso.Há uma quinta ETE que emprega processos físico-químicos que não emitem gases de efeito estufa. Uma fração do esgoto coletado em Belo Horizonte não é encaminhada para nenhuma estação de tratamento, sendo depositada diretamente no corpo d'água; outra fração de esgoto, que não é coletada, é presumivelmente tratada em sistemas sépticos (fossas sépticas), seguida de infiltração. Emissões de GEE por tratamento de resíduos sólidos urbanos - Aterro - Os resíduos sólidos gerados em Belo Horizonte são levados para disposição em aterro sanitário (CTR Macaúbas).  Uma fração do lixo coletado na cidade ainda está disposta ao centro de tratamento maciço CTR-BR-040, em Belo Horizonte, em uma área separada onde, a partir de 2010, iniciou um sistema de geração termelétrica a partir do biogás gerado no aterro. Assim, o biogás derivado do antigo resíduo maciço não deve ser considerado no inventário de GEE a partir de 2010. É considerado apenas a fração derivada das provisões em área separada recente e não coberta pelo sistema de recuperação de biogás.

Emissions sources are converted to CO2e using the emissions factors listed in the Australian National Greenhouse Accounts. Electricity and gas data was provided by utility operators by postcode and market segment (domestic, commercial, industrial). While best available, variations and discrepancies in the data are common from year to year. Emissions from private vehicle use were estimated using a transport model built by Council using reliable traffic count data from State government agencies, apportioned across vehicle class and fuel type based on survey data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Es importante recalcar que como menciona el GPC, la cuantificación y el reporte justo y real de emisiones de GEI  de una ciudad o municipio están basados en cinco principios fundamentales que incluyen: la relevancia, la exhaustividad, la coherencia, la transparencia y la precisión. Por otra parte  para el inventario con el que se cuenta 2012-2015 (recopilación de datos en 2012, se elaboró en 2013,  y finalmente se publicó en 2015) se aplicó la metodología del IPCC 2006 y Factores de Emisión (FE), en los que se presentan adecuaciones puntuales en respuesta a las características específicas de las actividades productivas en León; por mencionar algunas consideraciones, además se incluyó la producción artesanal de tabique, con apego a las disposiciones estipuladas en el Programa Especial de Cambio Climático (PECC). El cálculo de GEI y el inventario aquí presentado, son el primer paso para el emprendimiento de una serie de estrategias que atiendan la problemática del cambio climático en el municipio, con base en el registro de la cantidad total de GEI, su distribución en cada sector y las tendencias de generación de estos contaminantes por parte de los distintos sectores.  Asimismo, se añade la estimación de Carbono Negro (CN) para la realización del inventario municipal, por lo que fue necesario recurrir a diferentes fuentes de información oficial, con la finalidad de tener una base sólida y verídica de los datos a emplear para los cálculos de este capítulo. Igualmente se analizó información presentada en diferentes diagnósticos y estudios de áreas específicas dentro del municipio de León, como lo fueron los estudios realizados por el IMPLAN (Instituto Municipal de Planeación) en las zonas del Valladito y el Refugio por loa producción de ladrillos que se realiza en ambas zonas.";;POINT (-101.684 21.1221);;2017-06-01;Latin America;;public;Yes;2018-06-01;365 days;City / Municipality;Larger – covers the whole city and adjoining areas;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20;;0.0;2653478.0;2285593.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;;;;;;;Decreased;Technological change;1219.67;1578626.0;2015.0;;;;;;;2021-04-10T02:18:55.717

The carbon footprint is a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory that allows identifying the total carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emitted and the sources that generate this emission. On the other hand, the water footprint is an indicator to measure the volume of water required directly and indirectly, along the supply chain, to make a product or provide a service. In this sense, the quantification of the carbon footprint and water footprint of the District Municipality of Jesús María will cover the nine sectors of the district, taking into account the guidelines set out in international standards ISO 10064 (carbon footprint) and ISO 14046 (water footprint).It should be noted that the Greenhouse Gas Inventory has not yet been completed due to the health and economic crisis in which Peru finds itself as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic.;;;;2019-01-01;Latin America;;public;In progress;2019-12-31;364 days;City / Municipality;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, N20;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;4.57;75359.0;2019.0;;;;;;;2021-04-10T02:18:55.717

Stadt Zürich;35449;Switzerland;Zürich;;2020;2018-01-01 - 2018-12-31;Other, please specify: 2000-Watt-Methodology;The 2000-Watt society methodology is a concept of sustainable development that uses two indicators: Primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are identified according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).  Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.  Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the grey energy of net imported other goods and services.;;POINT (8.53918 47.3686);;2018-01-01;Europe;;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;City / Municipality;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, NF3, PFCs, SF6;;;892116.0;;269138.0;;;;;;;;;Decreased;Technological change;91.9;434008.0;2019.0;;;;;;;2021-04-10T02:18:55.717

Sandnes kommune;74695;Norway;;;2020;2018-01-01 - 2018-12-31;Regional or country specific methodology;"The greenhouse gasses CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are included in the accounts. The emission figures are shown with unit CO2 equivalents. This is a unit of measurement used to be able to compare the heating effect of different greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and to clarify which emissions contribute the most to global warming. Under ""Questions and answers"" this is further elaborated.The same methods and data sources are used for all the years covered by the statistics. The first year for which emissions are calculated is 2009. The reason for this is that there is either no data basis, or that the data basis does not have sufficient quality further back in time.The emission accounts use data sources that show the development at the local level to the greatest possible extent. The data sources, and also the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, can therefore vary from the national emission accounts. However, the method for calculations follows the principles in the national emission accounts.link: https://www.miljodirektoratet.no/tjenester/klimagassutslipp-kommuner/area=430&sector=-2";;;;2018-01-01;Europe;;public;Yes;2018-12-31;364 days;City / Municipality;Same – covers entire city and nothing else;;CO2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Decreased;;354.6;79559.0;2020.0;;;;;;;2021-04-10T02:18:55.717

ICLEI created the CCP campaign that aims to boost and support local governments to achieve measurable reductions in local GHG emissions. This framework starts with emission inventories and projections, proceeds with setting goals and developing an action plan, and culminates in the implementation and verification of emission-reducing measures. The CCP Protocol was developed to assist local governments to quantify their emissions, facilitating standardised comparisons between localities. This protocol refers to two comparative analyses - one for the local government operations and the other for the community as a whole.

In this way, the results described in the following chapters are intended to be comparable and acceptable on a global scale.The inventory prepared at the urban scale includes all the emission sources within the realm of authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality. The authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality covers the provincial boundaries of the province .The inventory content is based on the classification of emission sources set by GPC. When preparing inventory in the framework of GPC, the scope of the inventory was determined depending on the detail, accuracy and reliability of the available data. GPC evaluates greenhouse gas emissions in 3 scopes; Scope 1 - Direct Emissions, Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions and Scope 3 - Indirect (Consumption Based) Emissions. During the preparation of the inventory, all emission sources within the realm of authority of the municipality were scanned and the maximum amount of data was tried to be reached. The emissions under Scope 3 were not included in the inventory due to the fact that it is ver y difficult to reach related data . According to the results of the GPC approach, the total greenhouse gas emissions of Denizli province for the year 2016 were estimated to be 7.5 million tons of CO2e. This amount refers to 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita, which is proportional to the population of Denizli in the same year (1.005.687) and this number is higher than Turkey’s 2016 average calculated as 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita.
