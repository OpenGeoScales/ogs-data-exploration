# Data Provider Description

The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is part of the Leibniz Association with 95 other German research institutes in science. The PIK focuses its researches on the climate impact to reach a global sustainability and to bring knowledge and solutions for a more manageable climate in the future. These researches are guided by the integration of the planetary bounderies and the global commons. They are cross-disciplinary and cover Earth System Analysis, Climate Resilience, Transformation Pathways and Complexity Science.

The PIK is funded by the national and regional governments and also external sources.

To spread knowledge, to make it available for all and to make progress the scientific research, the PIK is commited to the Open Science Declaration of the Leibniz Association. Therefore, its pieces of software, models and data are shared at [this preliminary list](http://www.pik-potsdam.de///~hellmann/all-types/). The available data are outputs of models, collected data and combined datasets.
