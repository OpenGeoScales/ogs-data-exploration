Recap data name, source organization
Objectives/ data type/ Methodology","As of December 2020, Climate Watch Historical Emission data contains sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for 185 countries and the European Union (EU) for the period 1990-2016, including emissions of the six major GHGs from most major sources and sinks.  Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. See http://cait.wri.org/docs/CAIT2.0_CountryGHG_Methods.pdf for details regarding data source and methodology."
historical_emissions_cait,Cautions: Known use limitations/cautions regarding: geographic/content coverage; source (inconsistency); methodology ,"Climate Watch Historical GHG Emissions data (previously published through CAIT Climate Data Explorer) are derived from several sources. Any use of the Land-Use Change and Forestry or Agriculture indicator should be cited as FAO 2019, FAOSTAT Emissions Database. Any use of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion data should be cited as CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, OECD/IEA, 2019. As of March 2020, emissions from European Union (27) for all years no longer include emissions from United Kingdom on Climate Watch."

Recap data name, source organization
Objectives/ data type/ Methodology","The PRIMAP-hist dataset combines several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of greenhouse gas emission pathways for every country and Kyoto gas covering the years 1850 to 2017, and all UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member states, as well as most non-UNFCCC territories. The scenario in which country reported data (CRF, BUR, UNFCCC) is prioritized over third party data (CDIAC, FAO, Andrew, EDGAR, BP) is used on Climate Watch. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Waste is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Due to data availability and methodological issues, version 2.1 of the PRIMAP-hist dataset does not include emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report."

Objectives/ data type/ Methodology",The GHG inventory data from UNFCCC are provided in the annual GHG inventory submissions by Annex I Parties and in the national communications under the Convention by non-Annex I Parties.
historical_emissions_unfccc,Cautions: Known use limitations/cautions regarding: geographic/content coverage; source (inconsistency); methodology ,"Note 1: The reporting and review requirements for GHG inventories are different for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. The definition format of data for emissions/removals from the forestry sector is different for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Note 2: Base year data in the data interface relate to the base year under the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). The base year under the Convention is defined slightly different than the base year under the Kyoto Protocol. An exception is made for European Union (KP) whereby the base year under the Kyoto Protocol is displayed. Note 3: Some non-Annex I Parties submitted their GHG inventory data using the format of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in reporting GHG emissions/removals. For this reason, these data could not be included in the data interface. However, the data are available in the national communications (Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cabo Verde, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Fiji, Gambia, Grenada, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Jamaica, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Oman, Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, Samoa, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia, South Africa, Suriname, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Viet Nam, and Zambia) and biennial update reports (Afghanistan, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Benin, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Ghana, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Laos Peoples Republic, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Republic of Moldova, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Tajikistan, Togo, Tunisia, Uruguay, and Uganda). Note 4: – means ""No data available"". Note 5: Data displayed on the data interface are ""as received"" from Parties. The publication of Party submissions on this website does not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the UNFCCC or the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries as may be referred to in any of the submissions."
